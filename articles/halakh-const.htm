 Constitutional Perspective</font></h2>

<p align="justify">

<H3>Modern and Postmodern Stances on <I>Halakhic</I> Decision-Making
</H3></p><p align="justify">
With the breakdown of the premodern order and the coming of
modernity, new questions arose with regard to <I>halakhic</I>
interpretation, questions which reflected the changing conditions
of religious faith and belief that affected Jews as well as
non-Jews.  In the previous 2500 years or more a rather elaborate
and sophisticated system of <I>halakhic</I> interpretation had
developed, organized in the Talmud and elaborated on by the
Rishonim and Ahronim.  That system, however, was predicated on a
very traditional faith system which was rocked by the winds of
modernity in a revolution similar to the Copernican revolution
which overthrew the Ptolmaic system.</p><p align="justify">

This transformation of premodern faith into various versions of
modern and then postmodern faith and belief may be seen as a
continuing process, but so, too, were discussions of premodern
faith in their time.  This might overlook the revolutionary
transformations which have taken place in the grounds of faith
and belief.  Those revolutionary transformations which must be
grappled with in all such discussions are even more critical for
questions of <I>halakhic</I> interpretation.  </p><p align="justify">

To give the most extreme example, Jews who happen to be atheists,
because they deny the total existence of God, need not approach
<I>halakhah</I> as in any respect God-given or rooted in God-given
foundations.  They may chose to regard some <I>halakhic</I> elements as
folkways or they may regard all <I>halakhic</I> elements as obsolute or
irrelevant.  However, even for believers there have been radical
transformations.  For example, the Reform movement was founded on
a reemphasis in the belief in God as One who manifested Himself
in this world in modern liberal, progressive, and up-to-date
ways.  Thus the Reform movement could emphasize the belief in God
along with the abolition of the binding character of <I>halakhah</I>.
This allowed them to pick and choose among <I>halakhic</I> requirements,
now no longer required, on the basis of what they perceived to be
progress in the world and changes in modern sensibilities.</p><p align="justify">

By the same token, the Conservative movement has tried to have
its cake and eat it too.  On one hand it has proclaimed itself
irrevocably faithful to <I>halakhah</I>.  On the other hand, it feels
very pressured by the transformations of modernity and
postmodernity and the sensibilities that they have evoked.  Their
resolution of this conflict has normally involved <I>halakhic</I>
decision-making that reaches the same conclusions as modern
contemporary sensibilities and on finding the <I>halakhic</I> grounds to
do so.  Exactly how this should be done and to what extent, has
been a matter of continuing debate within the ranks of the
Conservative leadership. </p><p align="justify"> 

To give some examples, Solomon Schechter stood fast on <I>halakhic</I>
principles but attempted to make their presentation more
acceptable to moderns through institutional and stylistic
transformations.  Louis Ginsberg found his solution by separating
traditional <I>halakhic</I> requirements from modern academic
methodologies and living in a compartmentalized world.  Cyrus
Adler was willing to be very traditional on <I>halakhic</I> matters that
involved those elements of life defined as "religious" in the
late nineteenth century Western world, particularly the United
States of America, but rejected the political dimensions of
<I>halakhah</I> as being incompatible with modernity.  
</p><p align="justify">

Mordecai Kaplan went so far as to give <I>halakhah</I> "a vote but not a
veto" as he frequently said, to explicitly define <I>halakhic</I>
requirements as religious folkways to be taken seriously only up
to a point and then to entrust each generation with the right to
decide what is to be retained and what is not.  It seems that by
each generation, he meant the leadership of the generation but
not simply the <I>halakhic</I> or rabbinical leadership, even in their
modern adaptations, but the civil leadership, what had come to be
called the lay leadership as well.  After World War II and
particularly after the events of the late 1960s, the Conservative
movement leadership moved in the direction of accepting modern
sensibilities first and then finding <I>halakhic</I> ways to reflect
them that would not make the movement seem as if it were
non-<I>halakhic</I>.</p><p align="justify">

For a while the cutting edge of Orthodoxy also sought a
reconciliation with modernity in matters of faith, belief, and
religious behavior, although there always remained a strong
faction in Orthodoxy that accepted modernity only outside the
realm of faith, belief, and behavior, i.e., in connection with
technology, but otherwise insisted on maintaining the closed
premodern world.  That is, their Judaism was Ptolmaic while their
lives beyond were Copernican.  Since World War II, however, those
latter haredim or ultra-Orthodox have gained the upper hand
within the world of Orthodoxy and have pushed the so-called
modern Orthodox back toward a redefined centrist position that
accepts haredi premises and even further to the right religiously
in a conscious and militant rejection of modernism and its
postmodern child.  Nevertheless, even for them the problem of
<I>halakhic</I> interpretation has been reopened and they must rebuild
the system of interpretation, in their case in a manner far less
liberal than their premodern predecessors since they must
maintain a position of confrontation with modern and postmodern
developments.
</p><p align="justify">
In recent years there have been numerous suggestions as to
approaches to <I>halakhic</I> interpretation.  To put it simply, it is
probably fair to say that the Orthodox camp looks for continuity
based on immediately past precedents, following the lead of
earlier posekim (<I>halakhic</I> decisors) down to the latest
generation, even if that lead is increasingly narrow on the
theory that generations further from Sinai cannot know as much as
generations closer. Two other elements enter into Orthodox
interpretation: One, that the Torah is to be read through the
prism of the Talmud and not directly, especially, although not
exclusively, in matters of religious as distinct from civil law
(a distinction which in itself is not drawn or barely drawn in
<I>halakhah</I>).  Two, that it is possible to go back beyond one's
immediate predecessors in interpretation if one seeks more
restrictive interpretation and finds it among earlier posekim.
This is particularly useful to those in the haredi community who
seek an ever more rigid and stringent set of <I>halakhic</I>
requirements.  It has been useful in more moderate ways for those
elements in the modern or centrist Orthodox community, either for
Zionist reasons, that is, to revive practices that fell into
disuse in the diaspora because of lack of opportunity, or to
legitimize a certain amount of compartmentalization, i.e., living
in the external world as moderns, especially in terms of civil
law, while retaining the religious requirements of <I>halakhah</I>.
</p><p align="justify">
Conservative <I>halakhic</I> interpreters generally accept the premise
of filtering the Torah through the Talmud, but are willing to
turn directly to the Torah in more instances.  Their interpretive
approach is further modified by, one, a tendency toward the
acceptance of a positivistic view of the law, that is to say,
that the law is what the judges say it is, with a minimum of
recourse to earlier principles; two, that civil law is generally
obsolete outside of Israel and can be downplayed or ignored; and
three, religious law should be as close to the contemporary
temper of a particular age as it can possibly be without
jettisoning <I>halakhah</I> altogether.
</p><p align="justify">
The Reform movement, rejecting the binding character of <I>halakhah</I>,
has had something of a turn toward more traditional behavior on
the basis of "customs and ceremonies."  They have also developed
several <I>halakhic</I> experts of their own and, while not suggesting
that they are binding, have issued decisions along a whole front.
The problem, of course, is that those decisions are not binding.
Rabbis can choose to ignore them, accept them, or take some
position in between, which means that they are no more than
discussions of Jewish tradition couched in more legal language.
On the critical decisions such as recognizing patrilineal descent
for purposes of Jewishness, accepting women as rabbis and
cantors, and accepting homosexuals and lesbians as equals in
every aspect of Jewish life, no <I>halakhic</I> decisions are called for
and none are made.
</p><p align="justify">
<BR>
<H3>The Constitutional Approach and Its Virtues
</H3></p><p align="justify">
With the possible exception of the haredim, the movements in
Jewish life that feel bound by <I>halakhah</I> are thus faced with
problems of interpretation.  Curiously enough, the modern revival
of constitutionalism with its systematic interpretive
developments may offer a way to resolve the problem of <I>halakhic</I>
interpretation that remains faithful to the normative principles
of <I>halakhah</I>, being at once immutable yet adaptable through
interpretation in each generation.  This requires as a starting
point the acceptance of the Torah as a constitution, albeit an
ancient constitution that sets forth a comprehensive way of life
and not just a modern constitution which confines its concerns to
the establishment of an appropriate frame of government and
appropriate protections for human rights or, perhaps, adds an
enforceable ideological dimension as well.  Viewing the Torah as
a constitution in this way allows us to apply principles of
constitutional interpretation which have been worked out and
tested in the world of civil government to the Jewish environment
with its mixture of civil and religious laws rooted in obligation
to holiness, commanded by God.</p><p align="justify">

The Torah itself rather explicitly claims that it is a
constitution in that ancient sense and combines both the
draconian rules against direct formal amendment and the promise
of flexibility through interpretation by the judges of each
generation [Cite Deuteronomy].  Drawing from these secular
sources may seem like blasphemy but in fact it can be done within
the most unquestioning framework of belief as well as within a
context that involves substantial if not total abandonment of
belief.  That, indeed, may be its greatest recommendation for our
times. Even though the end result of the interpretive process may
vary considerably based on whether or not and to what extent
belief is involved, we will still have, insofar as it remains
possible in the modern age, established the basis for a common
dialogue, for interacting around the same questions, which often
is the major means of establishing the unity of a people
otherwise divided by different beliefs, even when or where common
answers cannot be expected.</p><p align="justify">

As yet, we have not even touched upon those who reject the
religious dimension of <I>halakhah</I> entirely but who seek to benefit
from the moral norms that inform its civil dimension as well,
some of whom are even capable of seeking spiritual sustainance in
what they perceive to be a non-religious way from the moral norms
that inform Torah and <I>halakhah</I>.  Since such people represent an
ever-growing number of Jews, especially Jews who care, to be able
to include them within a system of <I>halakhic</I> interpretation would
not only be no mean feat but would have to be welcomed with great
seriousness by those who seek to maintain the unity of the Jewish
people along some kind of faithfulness to Jewish tradition and
not merely identification with a common Jewish fate.

</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3>A Four-Fold Constitutional Approach
</H3></p><p align="justify">
What then can be used as points of reference for <I>halakhic</I>
decision-making in our time that can encompass all this yet be
sufficiently faithful to first principles? In my opinion, one can
construct a four-fold foundation on a constitutional basis for
rendering interpretations based on the following:
</p><p align="justify">

<OL>
	<LI>  The plain or literal meaning of the constitutional text.
	<LI>  The intentions of the text's framers.
	<LI>  The accumulated interpretations of later legitimate
	 interpreters of the text subsequent to the framers.
	<LI>  The sense of what would fulfill the text's purpose in light of
	 the present situation while at the same time not doing violence
	 to the text's plain sense and the intentions of the framers.
</OL>
</p><p align="justify">


This is an approach to any kind of constitutional interpretation
and can be applied within a religious as well as a civil
framework.  Let me elaborate on each of the four in turn.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3>I. The Plain or Literal Meaning of the Constitutional Text
</H3></p><p align="justify">

As we begin our quest for interpretation we have before us a text
or texts of varying degrees of constitutional validity.  For
example, the Torah is presented as a set of direct commandments
from God set in a canonized context which includes historical and
prophetic materials without claiming to be narrative or
chronological history per se but contextually relevant to
understanding the commandments.  This can be understood in
contrast to the Constitution of the United States which stands
alone.  This means that the constitutional sections of the Torah
have a built-in context to help us judge and understand their
literal or plain meaning, whereas modern constitutions keep the
context apart from the document. While this does not solve all
problems, it gives us a basis for providing solutions to most
that are agreed upon and to others where there is less agreement
but a number of sensible explanations.
</p><p align="justify">
Nevertheless there are problems.  (1) There are apparent
contradictions in the text that have to be properly understood in
each case.  (2) There are terms whose original meaning may have
been lost in the intervening millennia. (3) Texts or words may
have been garbled in the transmission over the centuries.  
</p><p align="justify">
In addition to these, there are several other possibilities.
These have to do with the interpretations of the framers, that is
to say, God and Moses (to be as traditional as possible), which
is something that the sages of the Talmud claimed, as in the
example that monetary damages constituted the original meaning of
"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."  The short and
sometimes cryptic character of the biblical text provides us with
a text but not necessarily one within which to understand the
intentions involved.  
</p><p align="justify">
It has generally been assumed that the intentions are linear and
of a piece.  It is only from the period of Ezra the Scribe onward
that we get dialogues of meaning.  More recently, some have
claimed that the Bible itself and even the Torah consists of
dialogues, discussions, and at times disagreements, as in the
Talmud, which need to be understood and in some cases reconciled.
This could be a great advance in approaching the plain text and
the problem of intentions.  We should approach it with some
caveats, however.  When the critical study of the Bible began,
biblical criticism was welcomed as the best way to elucidate the
plain text through comparative linguistics, for example, or
raising issues of garbled letters and words, but biblical
criticism soon took off to follow its own dynamic and ceased to
treat the text as a whole which, while it may or may not have
been compiled from several different texts at one point or
another in its early history, has come down to us as a single
whole and needs to be interpreted constitutionally as such.  Thus
the view of all or part of the Bible including the Torah as a
discussion and dialogue should be approached very judiciously.
</p><p align="justify">
It is also true that any worthy constitutional text has
ambiguities built into it to allow a variety of interpretations
and even changing interpretations over time.  A good constitution
includes some things that are very specific, such as the
scheduling of Sabbaths and festivals in the Torah or election
days in the U.S. Constitution, and other things which lend
themselves, even demand interpretation such as the form of
government (monarchic or republican) in the Bible and the
character of federal-state relations (dual or cooperative) in the
United States Constitution.  Sorting all of this out is not easy
and an accurate understanding of the meaning of words at the time
that the constitutional text was framed seems to be the first
anchor to which the quest must be tied, followed by an
understanding of the context in which the text was written.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>

<H3>II. The Intentions of the Framers
</H3></p><p align="justify">
The foregoing leads us to the question of the framers' intent.
Methodologically and operationally, the need to search for an
understanding of what the framers intended is much the same
whether we are speaking of human framers or a Divine Lawgiver.
The intentions of both rest upon wills which led them to have
intentions in the first place. Obviously violating the intentions
of human framers is less critical for a believing person than
violating the intentions of God, but the search for intentions
and the methodology of that search is not very different in the
case of one or the other, especially since according to the Bible
the intentions of God were conveyed to the people via His prophet
Moses after the people refused to receive even the first
constitutional statements of God directly (Exodus 19).
</p><p align="justify">
The matter of intentions becomes important because of the
grounding of all constitutional texts serving the political
societies of which we speak in mutual consent through covenant or
compact.  Let us exclude from our discussion those constitutional
systems which exclude consent, which involve unilateral actions
on the part of the constitution-makers that are forced on the
recipients.  There is, indeed, some question as to whether such
actions can be referred to as constitutional and there are those
who would argue with good cause that for something to be
legitimately constitutional it must involve consent.  Certainly
in our two exemplary cases, no matter how different they may be
in other respects, the role of consent is basic and critical,
either by their own account or by other contemporary accounts of
their drafting and adoption.  In both systems it is assumed that
those who are to be governed by the constitution have a right (in
American terminology) to know what is in it and what they are
accepting, or the drafters have an obligation (in biblical
terminology) to inform those to be governed of their intentions.
Both sets of framers, despite their great differences, do just
that.  
</p><p align="justify">
In the case of the Bible, God, through Moses, gave us the book of
Genesis and the books of the Prophets and Writings to elucidate
the meaning of the four books of the Torah that are essentially
constitutional.  In the case of the United States, records were
made of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, extensive
discussions were held in the state ratifying conventions and
preserved, and The Federalist, plus some other writings
supporting the Constitution of 1787 elucidate its meaning and in
the case of The Federalist, it is accepted as a primary
elucidation of intent.
</p><p align="justify">The intentions of the framers should be understood in two ways:
the original intention, that is to say, what they intended to
establish in the constitutional text, and the larger intention,
to what purpose they wanted to establish it.  Thus sometimes the
narrow terms of what they wanted to establish were adequate for
their times but they themselves wanted to leave an opening or we
ourselves would like to find an opening to fulfill their larger
intentions.  In some cases that requires formal constitutional
amendment where that is possible.  In others it will require
constitutional interpretation, searching out the framers' larger
intentions.
</p><p align="justify">
The minimum reason for accepting the framers' intentions as
determinative is that they are part and parcel of what the
governed have consented to.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3>III. Precedent
</H3></p><p align="justify">
Legal/constitutional systems must assume that the framers'
intentions need not be searched out anew from scratch each time
unless there is a compelling reason to do so. Rather, we may
follow the precedents of those who have tried to divine those
intentions earlier, often based on the idea that those closer to
the framers are likely to have a better understanding of what the
framers intended and that those closest may even have learned of
the meaning of the constitutional text and the framers'
intentions from the framers themselves.  Thus it is generally
wise to accept and build upon the decisions of previous
interpreters or decisors.  
</p><p align="justify">
The problem with that is that invariably there are distortions,
deliberate or mistakenly by the interpreters in interpreting both
the text and the intentions, and they, too, are influenced by
their times and places.  Thus their actions must be examined in
context as well so that current interpreters can react to them
properly.  This becomes even more important the longer a
constitutional text remains in force constitutionally.  
</p><p align="justify">
In short, legal study of precedents is not sufficient to continue
the process of interpretation.  There is also the need to
undertake historical and social scientific study of the context
to divine the earlier interpreters' reasons for interpreting as
they did.  Still, the reversal of the thrust of earlier
interpretation or precedent must be done very careful so as to
not upset the systematic aspects of a legal/constitutional system
and to destroy its stability, which often is what makes it
attractive and reassuring to the public served by it, a very
essential quality of law and a political requisite for any legal
system.  Still later constitutional interpreters who are too
wedded to precedent, even bad precedent, only further distort the
text and the intentions of the framers, usually laying the
groundwork or causing future revolutions which push things
further away and only by accident, if then, move us back to the
original texts and their framers' understanding of them.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>

<H3>IV. Contemporary Conditions
</H3></p><p align="justify">
After paying serious and due attention to the foregoing, we
arrive at the contemporary situation.  There is a reason why it
should be considered last and not first in constitutional
interpretation.  In civil polities there is always the
possibility of adopting a new constitution altogether if the
force of the contemporary situation is deemed by those served by
an older constitution to be such that radical change is
necessary.  However achieved, this is usually known as
revolution.  Thomas Jefferson, who had some experience in
drafting civil constitutions though not as much as some of the
other American framers, believed that since no constitution could
bind those who had not directly consented to it, every
constitution should be subject to change no less frequently than
every twenty years, at the point when approximately half of those
who had been alive at the time of the original framing have been
replaced by a new generation.  Whatever the theoretical
attractiveness of that idea in connection with civil
constitutions, it was too disruptive and cumbersome to work and
leaders and publics rapidly came to the conclusion that
constitutional development should be more continuous and less
disjointed.  This led to the development of theories of implied
consent, on one hand, and broadening of the power of
interpretation by authoritative sources, on the other.
</p><p align="justify">
Needless to say, religious constitutions, especially those
derived from Divine authority, cannot be so easily changed even
if their publics would want them to be.  Hence they must rely
even more heavily on interpretation.  That means, however, that
constitutions, as long as they are kept, require those bound by
them to be faithful to them if they are to have any meaning.
While great, even massive, changes of 180 degrees can be made by
clever interpretation and every constitutional system has
examples of that, I would argue that it is not desirable to do so
except perhaps in the most extraordinary circumstances, else the
constitution itself loses its authoritative and binding
character, de facto if not de jure.  If something is written in a
certain way and the intentions of its framers can clearly explain
why, then 180-degree turns that change whole meanings or even
radical steps short of that are delegitimizing.  
</p><p align="justify">
On the other hand, specifics that are not specifically stated are
amenable to greater change by interpretation in accord with
understandings of original intention when placed in the context
of contemporary situations.  For example, in the Bible, forms of
regime have had to change at different times, given the needs and
temper of the times. Thus it was important to discover the
intentions of the Torah with regard to the kind of government God
required rather than the particular form of government and to
make certain that every regime conformed to the former even if it
was based on a different set of institutions shaping the latter.
The Torah itself suggests that this is appropriate in its
discussion of the original Mosaic regime and the subsequent
regime of kingship introduced at the time of Saul and David.  
</p><p align="justify">
This kind of institutional change would be more difficult within
the context of a civil frame of government constitution such as
that of the United States where both offices and relationships
are specified, but even within that context large changes have
occurred, e.g., from a balance between the executive and the
legislative in early days, to congressional government in the
late nineteenth century, to the imperial presidency of the latter
half of the twentieth century.  Nevertheless, the system has been
self-corrective, usually restoring some measure of the basic
constitutional principles and practices in time, albeit on a
different plane.  Since the time span during which the
Torah-as-constitution has been in force is ten times that of the
U.S. Constitution, not to speak of its religious dimension, there
have been more changes of regime but a remarkable adherence to
the original constitutional intentions in most cases.
</p><p align="justify">
In sum, the contemporary context is critically important for a
constitutional interpreter, provided that it is considered not
alone and not as, in Ronald Dworkin's words, "trumps," but in the
context of the text itself, the intentions of its original
framers, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, their elaboration by
those interpreters that followed them.  This is of course more
easily said than done and it certainly will not eliminate
conflicting interpretations or the necessity for hard decisions,
but it should keep the dialogue of constitutional interpretation
within a common framework, much like a river may have different
currents and eddys, but, except in exceptional times of flood,
all stay within identifiable, even if changing, banks.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>

<H3>The Interpretive Debate
</H3></p><p align="justify">
In fact, interpretation is properly carried out through the
involvement of all actors in the continuing constitutional drama.
While those whom the body politic or religious designates as
authoritative interpreters may have a larger say and may seem to
have even more of a say than they do, proper constitutional
interpretation within a consensual context involves all others
within the body, and perhaps more than one body of authoritative
interpreters.  
</p><p align="justify">
For example, while the U.S. Supreme Court is deemed to have
ultimate authority in many situations, the Congress of the United
States has the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions,
change the court's jurisdiction and composition, and take other
actions that stake its own authoritative claim to interpretation,
while the president and the officers of the executive branch
interpret the constitution every day, most times in ways that
never reach other authoritative bodies.  At the same time,
historians, social scientists, and legal scholars have their
input by virtue of their studies of the context and impact of
constitutional texts and decisions.  Other jurisdictions who have
to apply authoritative interpretations may reinterpret them to
their satisfaction, reinterpretations that often go unchallenged.
The general public in their reaction to those selected
interpretations which strike them most vividly will subtly shape
both the application of current interpretations and future
interpretations of the same issue.  We have seen how this has
occurred in the United States in connection with the abortion
controversy but we can also note it in terms of the protection of
the rights of criminals and accused criminals, in connection with
pornography and obscenity, and in many other matters.  </p><p align="justify">

With regard to Jewish law we have a more complex situation.  When
all Jews (or essentially all of them) lived within the framework
of <I>halakhah</I>, public opinion was so powerful that the <I>halakhic</I>
decisors even included the dictum that halakhot were not binding
if the public could not live under them.  Today when most Jews
simply ignore questions of <I>halakhah</I>, if they do not openly reject
<I>halakhah</I>'s binding character, <I>halakhic</I> interpretation becomes
confined to those who consent to the system, and to the extent
that those who consent are those who are willing to accept ever
more rigorous interpretations in most cases, the mainstream of
the <I>halakhic</I> system has become more closed than it ever was.
While the side streams may have become more open, in doing so
they have also become less authoritative in the eyes of other
<I>halakhic</I> interpreters and even in the eyes of their own publics,
few of whom accept the binding character of <I>halakhah</I> in the first
place, while those who do, recognize the desperate maneuvers of
the side-stream <I>halakhic</I> interpreters to stay contemporary while
also remaining within the <I>halakhic</I> framework.</p><p align="justify">

Despite all of these problems, the four-fold context that I have
described here seems to me to offer the best, most accurate, and
most livable way of <I>halakhic</I> interpretation, one that permits its
constitutional dimension to be retained, that brings us back to
those first constitutional principles on a regular basis, yet
enables us to develop within a context and in light of
contemporary needs.  With all that, rules of interpretation, like
all other rules in human institutions, are not self-enforcing.
They depend upon the quality of the individuals who enforce and
interpret them.  Let us always pray that we have individuals to
do that who have the appropriate qualities.
