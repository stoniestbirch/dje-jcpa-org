</center><p><p align="justify"><BR>

Two of the most pronounced characteristics of modernity in

Western civilization are the radical separation between the

individual and the state in order to secure individual liberty,

on one hand, or the radical lack of separation to advance some

ideological effort to recast human nature, on the other.  The

former has been most characteristic of civil society in the

United States of America, the later, most characteristic of

totalitarian society in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,

at least until the recent effort to revive civil society in that

country. Despite the polar differences that separate them, they

also can be seen as two sides of the same coin, as De Tocqueville

perceptively and presciently pointed out in <I>Democracy in

America.</I><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></p><BR>



          <H3><CENTER> Modernity and Non-Governmental Institutions</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

One of their common aspects is the absence of a truly significant

place for non-governmental institutions in their respective

founding theories.  In totalitarian states, the nominal existence

of mediating institutions is simply a facade since they are

controlled by the state, or more likely, by the single

totalitarian political party that controls the state.  The matter

is more subtle in the contemporary United States. American

tradition and ideology require the maintenance of very

independent mediating institutions with real status and function

in the civil society.  In reality, however, both governmental

actions and the exercise of radical individualism have been

encroaching on them in a manner that has been ideologically

justified as serving the ends of democracy.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


While their position is justified by the ideology of pluralism,

the radically individualistic new pluralism embraced by many

increasingly undermines the intergenerational dimension that

gives mediating much of their authority and power in civil

society.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>  By the same token, contemporary ideologies emphasizing

equality of result have enabled government to encroach upon them

in the name of a greater good, further cutting into their

authority and power.  This is true of churches, universities,

professional associations, labor unions, and every other form of

public non-governmental association.  The very fact that they are

now referred to as mediating institutions distorts their original

character to indicate that they are somehow to be subordinated to

the individual on one hand and to the state, on the other.</p><p align="justify">


Increasingly, such institutions are truly authoritative and

powerful in the political-social fabric only in those polities

where they are associated with primordial groups, that is to say,

groups into which one is born and which are organically part of

each individual's identity.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT>  The importance of primordial group

institutions in the political-social fabric of the body politic

needs to be recognized by students of politics and society not

only in the premodern or modernizing societies of the Third World

but in the first and second worlds as well, where a resurgence of

primordial group identity, especially in Europe, has been an

unexpected development of the past generation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

The existence of these primordial groups is a reality but

theoretically they remain problematic in modern views of civil

society, especially those that emphasize individual liberty.  Are

they, then, merely realities that may have some useful

consequences fostering pluralism against a monolithic state?  Is

there any justification for human communities or collectivities

having sufficiently compelling qualities to be endowed with a

special status because they continue on an intergenerational

basis without necessarily being based on primordial groups?

Primordial groups make their own demands on their members which

may or may not be consistent with individualism, demands which

require recognition of the community or collectivity as a "good"

or "end" in itself. Is there a theory that can accommodate both

individual and communal liberty as true expressions of liberty as

we understand it?
</p><p align="justify">
Now that we are in the postmodern epoch and the battles of

modernity have been won, we need to reopen these questions for

reconsideration in light of the experiences of modernity.  We

must do so in a hardheaded manner without romanticizing our

premodern past or rejecting it out of hand.</p><p align="justify">


What seems to be most characteristic of that premodern past in

relation to these questions is that the body politic existed as a

seamless web.  Civil society, which required the existence of a

private sector side by side with the public sector, and in which

the public sector is divided into governmental and

non-governmental spheres, is, after all, a modern conception.

Some people, such as Karl Popper, have argued that as a result,

premodern society was essentially totalitarian, modified only by

its lack of effective methods to impose conformity.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT> To those who

hold this view, there is little difference between the ancient

polis and the contemporary Communist state other than size.  This

argument can be refuted with relative ease simply by noting the

fact that the polis or its equivalent, the tribe, were total

societies but, as such, did not have a separately articulated

state.  Their norms were those of tradition or traditional

religion, internalized by their citizens or members rather than

imposed by a separable, all-powerful state.
</p><p align="justify">

Where does that leave us, other than to satisfy us that our

ancestors were still better off than those who have had to

survive (or failed to survive) under twentieth century

totalitarian regimes.  Still, our ancestors did not have liberty

as individuals in the modern sense.  What, then, prevented the

body politic from imposing upon them in the way the totalitarian

state has done in our time.  Often, nothing beyond good will.  On

the other hand, in at least in one tradition, the Biblical

tradition, there were built-in limitations that recognized the

worth and dignity of the individual and the special status of the

community qua community. This paper will consider that tradition

as it was developed and applied in the political sphere on the

edge of the modern epoch by Johannes Althusius, perhaps the

greatest of the Christian political scientists to apply it in the

design of a proper commonwealth.  But first we shall look briefly

at the Biblical tradition itself.<P><BR>


<H3><CENTER>The Theory Presented in the Bible<BR>
 and its Reformed Protestant
                          Applications</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


The system presented in the Bible is among those that does try to

accommodate the individual in the commonwealth without abandoning

the fabric of the commonwealth as a collectivity with its own

responsibilities.  The basis for this effort is three-fold: first

of all, the idea that every individual is created in the image of

God, has a soul, and is holy.  Second, that it is the task of the

individual and the community, indeed the individual in the

community, to strive to be holy by observing not only what are
today referred to as prescribed religious rituals, but by doing

justice, providing for the poor, maintaining human freedom and

dignity, and assuring a basic economic floor for every household.
</p><p align="justify">

Third, every individual is morally autonomous and his or her

consent is required for all acts, even in response to God's

commandments. In biblical terminology, God commands but humans

hearken.  That is to say, they listen to God's commandment and in

essence decide whether or not to observe it.  Biblical Hebrew has

no word for obey.  All human actions require hearkening.
</p><p align="justify">

Fourth, humans act together through covenants and covenanting,

beginning with the foundation of existence, man's covenant with

God, whereby God enters into a partnership with humans for the

fulfillment and governance of this world. According to the terms

of the constitution which He has set before them, all human

organization flows from that original covenant and is ordered by

the subsidiary covenants to which the parties must consent and

which are morally binding under God who serves as partner,

guarantor, or witness.  All, of course, are based on consent and

the ability of the partners to make autonomous moral

commitments.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


While we do not know exactly how this biblical system worked in

practice in ancient Israel, we can gather some sense of its

reality in the way it has shaped the Jewish people who are noted
for their commitment to individual autonomy, liberty, and

equality, and for their striving to achieve one or another moral

end and the tendency to view public issues in moralistic terms

even as they are among the most communal, even tribal, of

peoples, tied together through a rich fabric of history and

destiny.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


The biblical worldview also entered Christianity when that

religion emerged out of Judaism, but it did not reach its full

flowering until the Protestant Reformation.  Reformed

Protestants, in particular, not only sought to foster the true

faith but to build the holy commonwealth.  The road to modern

democracy began with the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth

century, particularly among those exponents of Reformed

Protestantism (later rather mistakenly referred to as Calvinism)

who developed a theology and politics that set the Western world

back on the road to popular self-government, emphasizing liberty

and equality. In their efforts they turned to what they referred

to as the Old Testament -- the Hebrew Bible -- for guidance.
</p><p align="justify">

There they rediscovered the biblical teaching and sought to adapt

it to their Christian commonwealths.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT>  We know their principal

efforts as milestones in the history of liberty in the Western

world, albeit limited or flawed ones -- Zwingli's Zurich,

Calvin's Geneva, Knox's Scotland, Cromwell's England, Winthrop's

Massachusetts, Williams' Rhode Island, Hutchinson's Connecticut.

While several of these have been called theocracies, in fact,

they were only in the sense that they recognized God's

sovereignty as the basis of the commonwealth and tried to use

God's law as its foundation.  As in ancient Israel, they divided

authority and power among magistrates and ministers, civil and

ecclesiastical rulers. (In ancient Israel, as in every Jewish

polity, the division was three-fold, between civil rulers,

expounders of the Torah, and priests, but that need not concern

us here.) The magistrates were as much responsible for

maintaining the moral foundations of the community as the

ministers.</p><p align="justify">


However limited these regimes were from the perspective of modern

democracy, they did advance the cause of republicanism and

strengthened the foundations of what later became democratic

republicanism.  All were established by covenant.  In the case of

Rhode Island and Connecticut, they were also federal in the more

conventional sense of being federations of towns.

</p><p align="justify">
Their great limitations were two: Because they were led by

militant reformers during the first flush of the Reformation,

most insisted on orthodoxy and expelled or persecuted (and on

occasion even executed) those whom they deemed heretics.  Nor did

they leave room for individualism in the more private ways that

we understand to be necessary.  If the truth be told, those that

survived the initial revolutionary period settled down to be

bourgoise republics until engulfed by some later revolution or

conquest.  As such they allowed considerable room for private

behavior as long as community norms were publicly honored.
</p><p align="justify">
A number of the foregoing figures, particularly Calvin, Knox and

Roger Williams and to a lesser extent Zwingli and John Winthrop,

developed political theories to accompany their work of

governing.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT> 

 All however, were primarily theologians.  While

they and the other original founders and spokesmen for Reformed

Protestantism did much political writing, their writing was

either theological or polemic in character.  Only at the end of

the first century of the Reformation did a political philosopher

emerge out of the Reformed tradition who built a systematic

political philosophy out of the Reformed experience by

synthesizing the political experience of the Holy Roman Empire

with the political ideas of covenant theology.  That man,

Johannes Althusius, presented his political philosophy in a

classic work, <I>Politica Methodice Digesta,</I> first published in 1603

and revised in final form in 1614.  It remained for Althusius,

political scientist by his own self-definition, to develop a

theory and philosophy of a compound polity that took most of

these problems into consideration.<P><BR>


               <H3><CENTER>Johannes Althusius and his Politics
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Althusius must be considered a figure located at the intersection

of the major trends of Western culture.  One of the Protestant

Christian grand designers, he straddled the Reformation and the

opening of the modern epoch.  Accordingly, he made an effort to

synthesize and somewhat secularize Reformed Protestant thought on

the ideal polity and to push it in concrete, practical

directions.</p><p align="justify">



Althusius was born in Westphalia, one of the German states, about

1557.  He was educated at the universities of Cologne and Basle,

where he received his doctorate in civil and ecclesiastical law

in 1586.  He then received an appointment to the Reformed Academy

of Herborn to teach law.  There he spent his academic career,

becoming rector in 1697.  He published his third and most

important book, <I>Politica Methodice Digesta</I> while at Herborn.

Althusius wrote as a political scientist -- as one who was

interested in the theory of the political order, the philosophy

behind that theory, and the practical dimension of human behavior

that must be addressed and accommodated.  Apparently as a result

of that book, he was invited to become Syndic of Emden in East

Friesland.  Knowing the "Geneva of the North", Emden had embraced

Reformed Protestantism in 1526, one of the first cities in

Germany to do so.  With the Netherlands just across the border,

it was very influential in educating the leaders of Dutch

Calvinism and, as a seaport, maintained close connections with

the Reformed Protestants of the British Isles.  In a way, it was

the fulcrum of northern Calvinism during the time of the Dutch

revolt against Spain, the rise of Presbytarianism in Scotland,

and the Catholic reaction in England. Althusius served Emden as

Syndic from 1604 to his death in 1638. He was elected an elder of

the church in 1617 and from then on served in both capacities.

He published two enlarged editions of the Politics, in 1610 and

1614.
</p><p align="justify">

This paper will not attempt to present a comprehensive summary of

Althusian theory, rather it will be directed to outlining the

form of civil society in the Althusian view, which itself is

derived from Althusius's understanding of Biblical teaching on

the subject.  While he relied on many classical and contemporary

sources as well, first and foremost was Scripture, so much so

that for him, the others were merely a means to elucidate

biblical teaching. Althusius saw in the Biblical polity, the

ideal regime.  As he put it:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    I more frequently use examples from sacred scripture because

    it has God or pious men as its author, and because I consider

    that no polity from the beginning of the world has been more

    wisely and perfectly constructed than the polity of the Jews.

    We err, I believe, whenever in similar circumstances we

    depart from it.  (Preface to the 3rd ed. Carney p. 10)
</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p align="justify">


What emerges from the <I>Politics,</I> then, is a biblically-informed

theory of the polity and the society it serves, presented in the

systematic fashion of Western political philosophy and adapted to

the conditions of Western civilization at the juncture between

end of the medieval and beginning of the modern epochs.

Althusius' <I>Politics</I> was the first book to present a comprehensive

theory of federal republicanism rooted in a covenantal view of

human society derived from, but not dependent on, a theological

system.  It presented a theory of polity-building based on the

polity as a compound political association established by its

citizens through their primary associations on the basis of

consent, rather than a reified state, imposed by a ruler or an

elite.</p><p align="justify">


Althusius published the last edition of his <I>Politics</I> in 1614;

just on the eve of the philosophic revolution of the 17th

century. Ironically, his contribution was ignored, if not

forgotten, for the next three hundred years; considered only by

Otto von Gierke in the 19th century as part of Gierke's effort to

revive medieval forms for the development of a modern German

political thought and a few other German thinkers.<FONT SIZE="-1">12</FONT>  Althusius

was rediscovered by Carl Friedrich who published a complete Latin

edition of the <I>Politics</I> in 1932 with an extensive (if, in my

opinion, a somewhat misleading) introduction.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT>  Frederick Carney

prepared his masterfully digested translation of the <I>Politics</I> in

English nearly thirty years later.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT>  His was and remains the

first translation of the <I>Politics</I> in any vernacular language.

</p><p align="justify">
Althusius was ignored because his philosophy was bounded by the

same biblical principles of polity-building that informed

Reformed Protestantism and that were rejected by modern statist

political thought.  In many respects, he was the theoretical

godfather of modern federalism but was never recognized as such

because of what were deemed archaic elements in the form of his

thought.  It is doubly ironic, then, that precisely for those

reasons which lead him to be rejected by the moderns he becomes

useful to us in the postmodern epoch.
</p><p align="justify">
Modern political philosophy is based upon a revolution in the

theory of natural right which was deemed to be rooted in the

natural psychology of humanity and methodological individualism.

It is rooted in the liberal principle that the individual is the

only atom from which to begin the construction or analysis of

civil society.  While early modern thought recognized and

emphasized that all society is civil society, organized

politically from its foundations (in contradistinction to 19th

century views of the subjects which sought the "automatic

society" that existed independently of political organization),

it also emphasizes that civil society's governmental dimension

should be limited; indeed as limited as possible.</p><p align="justify">


We postmoderns understand the truth and vital importance of that

revolutionary modern idea.  But we also understand that while it

may be the truth it is not necessarily the whole truth.  We may

better understand that, while individual liberty is essential for

us all, so, too, are the institutions of family and community so

that the public institutions of civil society will rest on the

proper foundations; not only in the way that they are constituted

but in terms of the private dimension in which they serve to

function as they are intended to function.  The character of the

<I>res publica</I> (or commonwealth) depends on the character of the

public it serves and just as there can be no <I>res publica</I> without

a public so does the character of the <I>res publica</I> rest upon the

kind of public within it.
</p><p align="justify">

Prior to modernity it was extremely difficult to separate the

public and the private within the community.  Modernity made it

possible for us to separate them.  The postmodern epoch must find

a way for them to live together.  In this, the Biblical approach

as developed by Althusius may be of help.<P>
<BR>


                  <H3><CENTER>The <I>Res Publica</I> of Althusius</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

In essence, Althusius emphasized that the greatest safeguards for

liberty were to be found in the structuring of the body politic

into five permanent associations: two private -- the family and

the collegium -- and three public -- the city, the province, and

the commonwealth.  It was through those permanent structures that

individuals were able to function, to be represented, and

preserve their liberties.  It is important to recognize that

Althusius distinguished between public and private associations.

That is to say, he provided the basis for civil society without

assuming methodological individualism as its underlying premise.

The private sphere was real and was protected not by abstract

principle alone but by the constitutional authority and political

power of the family and the collegium as private institutions.

The individual for Althusius (as for the Bible) was a reality

because every individual was created in God's image with his or

her own soul.  But individuals did not stand naked in the face of

powerful public institutions, rather, they were protected by

being located within families and collegia.

</p><p align="justify">
Nor was that deemed sufficient.  The public sphere, too, was

divided into three arenas, the city, the province, and the

commonwealth, each with its own structure that gave each its

authority and empowered each to play its role.  At first glance

this seems to be a variant of the medieval corporalist model and,

indeed, some have argued that Althusius was only a modified late

medieval corporatist.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT>  A better case can be made however

Althusius developed a different model based on political and

social covenants.

</p><p align="justify">
Let us be more specific.  Althusius' <I>Politics</I> is concerned with

ordering and communication, both done through the process of

association <I>(consociatio)</I> -- what he terms symbiotics.

Symbiotics is the art and science of association.  Every proper

association has its own vocation or calling which is directly or

indirectly established by covenant.  A proper politics rests on

both piety and justice as reflected in the two tables of the

Decalogue, the first of which states the fundamental laws of

piety and the second the fundamental laws of justice.
</p><p align="justify">

Althusius begins the body of his book by stating:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">
    Politics is the art of associating <I>(consociandi)</I> men for the

    purpose of establishing, cultivating, and conserving social

    life among them.  Whence it is called "symbiotics."  The

    subject matter of politics is therefore association

  <I>  (consociatio),</I> in which which the symbiotes (those who live

    together) pledge themselves each to the other, by explicit or

    tacit agreement, to mutual communication of whatever is

    useful and necessary for the harmonious exercise of social

    life.

</p>
<p align="justify">

    The end of political "symbiotic" man is holy, just,

    comfortable, and happy symbiosis, a life lacking nothing

    either necessary or useful.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">


Symbiotics and communication are the central elements of his

system.  Communication for Althusius is the sharing of things,

services and right <I>(jus,</I> i.e. right as law). Like all covenantal

systems it emphasizes relationships first and foremost, that are

secured through their embodiment in proper institutions.
</p><p align="justify">

There are two kinds of associations -- simple and private and

mixed and public.  Among the former are the family and the

collegium.  The family is a natural association which takes the

form of a comprehensive union, while the <I>collegium</I> is a limited

civil association.  There are two kinds of families based on

conjugal and kinship relations.  A <I>collegium</I> is any private

association in which "three or more men of the same trade,

training, or profession are united for the purpose of holding in

common such things they jointly profess as duty, way of life or

craft".  Secular <I>collegia</I> are those composed of magistrates and

judges or people engaged in common agricultural, industrial or

commercial pursuits.  An ecclesiastical collegium is composed of

clergymen, philosophers or teachers.

</p><p align="justify">
Among the mixed and public associations are the city, the

province and the commonwealth, each of which has a civil and an

ecclesiastical dimension.  While each is autonomous in its own

sphere, the commonwealth is the most comprehensive and, as such,

is the universal association. There are two forms of universal

association -- the <I>res publica</I> or commonwealth and the regnum or

realm, with the former preferred.  Althusius as a political

scientist emphasizes that he deals with the reality of political

life; not only with the "ought" as do jurists but with the "is",

hence his recognition that there are regna as well as res

publica.

</p><p align="justify">
In his twofold division, Althusius implicitly recognizes the two

dimensions of what he refers to as symbiotics presented in the

Bible, namely kinship and consent. As a natural private

association, Althusius sees the family as a permanent union of

its members "with the same boundaries as life itself".  The

collegium, on the other hand, as a civil private association, is

more voluntary and "need not last as long as the lifetime of man"

even though "a certain necessity can be said to have brought it

into existence".  In these associations there is a balance

between necessity and volition. However natural the family may

be, it is based upon a tacit or expressed agreement among its

members ordering the manner of its communication or sharing of

things, services and rights.
</p><p align="justify">

However strong its roots in kinship, the continued existence of

the family is essentially a confirmation of this tacit or

expressed agreement.  Althusius realistically recognizes that

some families do not continue to exist.
</p><p align="justify">
For our purposes here, the critical instrumentality in Althusius'

system is the <I>collegium. </I> The primary civil association, it is a

body organized by assembled persons according to their own

pleasure and will to serve a common utility and necessity in

human life." (p. 28) There can be all kinds of collegia with all

kinds of purposes. Althusius brings lengthy examples from the

history of Israel, Egypt, and ancient Rome.
</p><p align="justify">

Althusius holds that it is in the nature of a <I>collegium</I> that its

members "agree among themselves by common consent on a manner of

ruling and obeying for the utility both of the whole body and of

its individuals." (p. 28)  The essence of the <I>collegium</I> for

Althusius consists of "men united by their own consent"

(Dicaelogicae I,8.).  Essential to the voluntary character of the

collegium is the fact that it is transitory and can be

discontinued by being "disbanded honorably and in good faith by

the mutual agreement of those who have come together, however

much it may have been necessary and useful for social life on

another occasion." (p. 28)  Since the <I>collegium </I>is outside the

family, it is a civil association, albeit a private one.  Unlike

Bodin who defines all activities outside of the home as the

activities of citizenship, Althusius distinguishes membership in

the collegium from citizenship, referring to members as

"colleagues, associates, or even brothers" (p. 29)

</p><p align="justify">

Althusius insists upon a minimum of three people to form a

collegium so as to overcome dissension.  Althusius cites many

biblical examples of <I>collegia,</I> in this case more particularly in

the New Testament than in the Old, no doubt because Christianity

organized itself on a voluntary basis within an existing civil

society, while the Israelites developed as a single comprehensive

people or commonwealth. [Examples of this association can be seen

in Acts 6:2f.; 12:12; 13:15, 27; 15:21; 28:23, 30f.; Matthew 4;

6:2; 10:24; 13; Exodus 29:42; Numbers 10:10.]  Upon this

Scriptural base, Althusius builds his discussion of the collegium

on Roman law (Carney, p. 29, ftnt 3).  Colleagues are equals

unless they organize themselves otherwise.  Decision-making is by

majority rule and decisions pertain "jointly and wholly to the

colleagues as a united group, but not in matters separately

affecting individual colleagues outside the corporate

fellowship." (p. 32)  Althusius even requires a quorum of

two-thirds of all members to make decisions.  "In matters common

to all, one by one, or pertaining to colleagues as

individuals...even one person is able to object." (p. 32)  "The

reason is that in this case what is common to everyone is also my

private concern." (p. 32) The president, rector, or director of

the collegium is elected by the colleagues.  He is "superior to

the individual colleague but inferior to the united

colleages...whose pleasure he must serve...." (p. 29)</p><p align="justify">


Althusius continues, "communication among the colleagues is the

activity by which an individual helps his colleague, and so

upholds the plan of social life set forth in covenant agreements.

"These covenants and laws (pacta et leges) of the colleagues are

described in their corporate books.... Such communication

pertains to (1) things, (2) services, (3) right and (4) mutual

benevolence" communicated by the collegium.  (pp. 29-32)
</p><p align="justify">

Because the idea of the <I>collegium</I> at first glance resembles

guilds common to the medieval city, many assume that it is merely

a restatement of medieval cooperatism.  This is not the case.

Althusius' reform is to emphasize the voluntary, transient, and

limited nature of the collegium as distinct from the feudal

corporate structure of the guild.
</p><p align="justify">

In the case of the <I>collegium,</I> Althusius adds communication of

something beyond things, services, and rights -- namely, mutual

benevolence, parallel to the biblical concept of <I>hesed</I> (covenant

love) or <I>re'ut</I> (neighborliness).  Althusius defines mutual

benevolence as "that affection and love of individuals toward

their colleagues because of which they harmoniously will and

'nil' on behalf of the common utility" (p. 32).  He understands

that this kind of brotherly love is necessary for the <I>collegium</I>

as a moral community of colleagues.  For Althusius, as for all

proper covenantal thinkers, covenants are not enough.  There must

also be a covenantal dynamic as symbolized by <I>hesed</I> and <I>re'ut
</I>
which is "nourished, sustained, and conserved by public banquets,

entertainments, and love feasts." (p. 32)  
</p><p align="justify">

Since the <I>collegium</I> develops from a natural need, it is not

completely voluntary and presumably would not be disbanded unless

alternate means existed to meet the needs for which it arose in

the first place.  While it comes into existence through an act of

will and covenant it is this relationship to neccesity that makes

it more than merely a matter of individual choice.  Althusius

emphasizes that all five of the associations he describes are

rooted in necessity although their existence, form, and means of

communication are determined through acts of will and covenant.
</p><p align="justify">

Unlike public associations where individual participation is

essentially indirect, in the collegium the colleagues can

participate directly.  Still, they need a leader to administer

the affairs of the collegium. That leader is "bound by the

purposes for which the collegium exists, and by the laws defined

through its corporative processes (Carney, page xxii)".
</p><p align="justify">

Public associations are directly constituted by families and

collegia, not individuals, with families and collegia

constituting cities, cities constituting provinces, and provinces

commonwealths.  What is critical here is that while public

association also exists out of necessity, a public association

cannot come into existence or continue to exist without the

private associations that constitute it.  Again for Althusius

this is a matter of reality and not only of right.
</p><p align="justify">

There is also another distinction between private and public

associations.  Public associations are territorial, that is to

say they have jurisdiction over specific territory, while private

associations are not.  Thus the two forms of associations

together cover the two principle options for human organization.

Private civil associations, in particular, offer means to modify

or supplement the territoriality of public associations.

Althusius' Latin term for association, consociatio, has been

revived in our times as consociationalism to describe

institutionalized political power sharing on a non-territorial

basis, i.e. a kind of non-territorial federalism.  Further than

that distinction however, the same general principles of

communication and rule apply equally to both forms of

association.  This is a major departure from medieval Roman law

in which public associations were essentially hierarchical and

administrative, that is to say, they served an imperial power

pyramid.  Althusius makes public associations symbiotic i.e.

covenantal, of the same general genus as private associations.

Basing both on the same sources of legitimacy and modes of

operation is a major federal element in Althusian thought.

</p><p align="justify">
There are two forms of public association -- particular and

universal.  In the full-fledged commonwealth, the city and the

province are particular forms of association while the res

publica or regnum is universal.  Sovereignty, which Althusius

clearly vests in the people (see below) is vested in the people

of the universal public association which, in a sense, is what

distinguishes it as universal.  In that sense, the question of

the locus of popular sovereignty determines what is universal and

what is particular rather than the other way around. Althusius

recognizes that city/states like Venice are universal

associations since they have commonwealth status.  In a sense

this unstated reversal is part of a further inconsistency in the

status of provinces. The realistic political scientist looking at

the Holy Roman Empire of Althusius' time had to take note of its

formally feudal structure, whereby Princes, Dukes, Counts or

other nobility who ruled provinces were at least nominally

subsidiary to the Holy Roman Emperor, the Supreme Magistrate,

rather than chosen by the citizenry, thus partly compromising the

symbiotic foundations of provincial rule.
</p><p align="justify">
All three public associations are governed through a system of

separation of powers, with a Senate or similar body representing

the people through representatives from their private

associations and a chief executive who presides over the

communication of things, services and rights.  The task of the

Senate is to establish, defend and if necessary modify the

fundamental laws of the public association.  Under certain

circumstances it may even remove the chief executive.</p><p align="justify">


Critical in the rule of every public association are the

ecclesiastical, civil and private associations -- what we today

refer to as mediating institutions that provide the basis for

representation in the public associations.  Ecclesiastical

associations are not only concerned with piety in the traditional

sense but also with public education in both religion and the

liberal arts.
<P><BR>

          <H3><CENTER> Constitutional Design or the Rules of Order
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

Althusius emphasizes that one of the principal rights of a

commonwealth is the communication of rights by the citizens among

themselves.  The basis for this communication of rights is

embodied in the jus commune, here the common right, fundamental

law or constitution of an association.  Althusius uses the term

jus commune in two senses: as referring to God's divine

constitution, the unchanging moral law binding upon all people

and their associations (on this larger constitutional meaning see

Chapters 21 and 22); and also more narrowly to refer to the

constitutional foundations of particular associations .
</p><p align="justify">

Voluntary associations may establish their own statutes in the

framework of public law and in harmony with their jus commune

which is customarily written in the association's records.  The

constitution is best established by the common consent of the

colleagues or citizens but (in an allowance for late medieval

reality) it may be granted to them as a special privilege by a

superior magistrate.  Althusius does not distinguish between

covenants and constitutions, treating every constitution as a

covenant and using the terms almost interchangeably as in his

discussion of the "covenant or constitution by which the supreme

magistrate is constituted by the Ephors with the consent of the

associated bodies..." (p. 118).
</p><p align="justify">

Althusius discusses the more comprehensive jus commune in his

chapters on political prudence.  The constitutional ordering of

rules, then, is an act of political prudence.<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    "The rule of living, obeying, and administering is the will

    of God alone, which is the way of life, and the law of things

    to be done and to be omitted.  It is necessary that the

    magistrate rule, appoint, and examine all the business of his

    administration with this law as a touchstone and measure,

    unless he wishes to rule the ship of state as an unreliable

    vessel at sea, and to wander about and move at random.  Thus

    administration and government of a commonwealth is nothing

    other than the execution of law. Therefore, this law alone

    prescribes not only the order of administering for the

    magistrate, but also the rule of living for all subjects...."

    (p. 134)

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">
    "...law in the general sense is a precept for doing those

    things that pertain to living a pious, holy, just, and

    suitable life. That is to say, it pertains to the duties that

    are to be performed toward God and one's neighbor, and to the

    love of God and one's neighbor...."  "...laws or rights in

    human society are as fences, walls, guards, or boundaries of

    our life, guiding us along the appointed way for achieving

    wisdom, happiness, and peace in human society." (p. 134)

</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p align="justify">

Basing his discussion on biblical sources (particularly Romans

I:19 and II:14f), Althusius sees the jus commune as "naturally

implanted by God in all men." (p. 134) At that level, "this jus

commune is set forth for all men nothing other than the general

theory and practice of love, both for God and for one's

neighbor." (p. 135)  Althusius soon moves beyond that because he

notes that this law is "not inscribed equally on the hearts of

all.  The knowledge of it is communicated more abundantly to some

and more sparingly to others..." (p. 135).</p><p align="justify">


The next step is the writing down of this constitutional law in

the Decalogue.  Its first table deals with love of God and piety

and the second, love of man and civil or political life.

Althusius refers to the Ten Commandments as "mandates and

precepts" but indicates that in the Bible they are referred to as

"judgements, statutes, and witnesses."  His analysis of each of

the commandments sets forth what he understands to be the general

constitution of all humanity.  As he says, "the Decalogue has

been prescribed for all people to the extent that it agrees with

and explains the common law of nature for all peoples" (p. 139).</p><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    "Proper law<I> (lex propria)</I> is the law that is drawn up and

    established by the magistrate on the basis of common law <I>(lex

    communis) </I>Althusius uses jus and lex interchangeably in this

    particular discussion] and according to the nature, utility,

    condition and other special circumstances of his country.  It

    indicates the peculiar way, means, and manner by which this

    natural equity among men can be upheld, observed, and

    cultivated in any given commonwealth." (p. 139)  <I>Lex propria
</I>
    has two parts: that which is in agreement with the <I>jus</I>

    commune,<I> (convenientia), </I>and that which is different from it

   <I> (discrepantia).</I>


</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p align="justify">
He then turns to focus more explicitly on Jewish proper law which

is divided into ceremonial law and forensic or civil law, the

first designed to aid in the observance of the first table of the

Decalogue and the second designed to make possible the

maintenance of the second.  With regard to the ceremonial law, he

follows the Orthodox Christian view.  It leads to Christ and

should now be viewed through the teachings of Jesus.  With regard

to the civil law, however, "it follows that the magistrate is

obligated in the administration of the commonwealth to the proper

law of Moses so far as moral equity or common law are expressed

therein." (p. 143)  At the same time, the proper law of Moses

which is not so directed should not be compulsory in a Christian

commonwealth.</p><p align="justify">


Every institution in the commonwealth needs to have its rules

established by consent of its citizens or members and written

down.  In other words, they must be in covenantal form and in

harmony with God's original covenant with ancient Israel as

embodied in the Decalogue.  As a covenant, the constitution is a

reciprocal contract, binding all parties to it whether equals or

unequals, that is to say, rulers and ruled, and granting powers

as determined by the body of the association.  Such a

covenant-constitution is designed to prevent any exercise of

absolute power within the association.  Althusius makes it clear

that "power...is established for the utility of those who are

ruled, not of those who rule, and the utility of the

people...does not in the least require unlimited power." (p. 117)

Althusius is very strong on the point that "absolute power is

wicked and prohibitive...even almighty God is said not to be able

to do what is evil and contrary to His nature." (p. 117)
</p><p align="justify">
This brief, structurally oriented description of Althusius'

system does not do it justice.  Critical to understanding how

this structure is to work is Althusius' emphasis on communication

as the sharing of things, services and right.  Institutions exist

as means to order and foster communication or sharing in a

situtation where consent is the foundation of the commonwealth.

Althusius is resolutely opposed to tyranny in part because it is

unjust and in part because he sees it as ineffective.
</p><p align="justify">
As a result of his emphasis on covenant and communication,

Althusius has essentially rejected the reified state and with it,

statism.  His idea of vesting sovereignty in the people through

their associations counters the argument of Jean Bodin that there

must be a single point in which sovereignty is concentrated; in

Althusius' time, the monarch and, later, the reified state.  In

this Althusius is a precursor of the solution devised by the

founders of the United States to resolve the problem of

sovereignty by vesting it in the people.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT>  The American founders

had an easier time of it because of the more homogeneous

character of the people to whom they addressed their solution.

In the more complex and heterogeneous society of German Holy

Roman Empire, the Althusian idea of vesting sovereignty in the

people through their associations offered a role to both soften

the impact of the "state" and to preserve the diverse primordial

and civil ties that characterize European society.
</p><p align="justify">

In all this Althusius has provided a proper application of the

biblical model.  For the Bible, only God is ultimately sovereign.

Politically, however, sovereignty is vested with the people, who

possess operational sovereignty within the framework of God's

constitution.  For the Bible, that constitution is the Torah; for

Althusius, it is the Decalogue.  Thus, the two expressions of

sovereignty come together in a constitutional document that,

barring direct Heavenly intervention, becomes the actual source

of authority, which can be modified by the people within the

limits imposed by the laws of piety and justice represented by

the two tables of the Decalogue.  This constitutional document

and the network of associations, symbiotic relationships and

communication of things, services, and right/law are in a sense

the best protection against tyranny and for what we would today

call human rights.
</p><p align="justify">
What of the matter of rights?  For both the Bible and Althusius,

the question of rights is derived essentially from the question

of justice and the human obligation of God to act justly.

Politics is symbiotics in communication. It provides the

framework and the means to act justly and to do justice.  Thus

the fundamental associations of political community -- public and

private, civil and natural -- are media for doing justice.</p><p align="justify">


Beyond that, each form of association forms a particular kind of

moral community within which justice is to be achieved and right

or rights protected in a different way. One of the principal

lessons of Althusius' teaching for us today is that humans are

organized in different moral communities, and right or rights

with regard to each must be treated in a manner appropriate to

it.
</p><p align="justify">

The modern worldview, by emphasizing the individual standing

naked against civil society as represented by government, has

increasingly come to emphasize the legal enforcement of legally

defined rights.  Originally applied to government alone, this

approach to rights has been extended to other forms of civil

associations and even more recently to natural associations,

public and private, because of that oversimple and limited

perception of the political relationship underlying civil

society, what constitutes rights, and how they are to be

enforced.
</p><p align="justify">
In a just society, there must be an appropriate conceptualization

of right and rights for relationships within each different kind

of moral community with appropriate means of enforcement.  In

ancient and medieval society, much justice was promised without

sufficient means of enforcement.  Modern political thought

successfully attacked that problem by providing means of

enforcement but, in the process, rejected a more complex view of

what constitutes justice or right, a view based upon an

understanding of the different forms of association in which

humans are involved, recognizing the fact that all such

associations being established on the basis of covenant includes

the dimensions of justice and right and establishes or

systematizes relationships upon which appropriate theories of

rights and rights enforcement can be based.

</p><p align="justify">
Trained in theology and jurisprudence, Althusius became a

political scientist and indeed makes a strong argument that

politics is the equal of the first two disciplines. In his

Preface to the first edition, Althusius goes into a long

discussion of the relationship between political science,

theology, and jurisprudence, and the separation between them,

summarizing the task of the political scientist as follows:</p><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    A political scientist properly teaches what are the sources

    of sovereignty and enquires to determine what may be

    essential for the constituting of a commonwealth.  The

    jurist, on the other hand, properly treats of the right <I>(jus</I>

    or law) that arises at certain times from these sources of

    sovereignty in the contract entered into between the people

    and the prince.  Both therefore discuss the rights of

    sovereignty, the political scientist concerning the fact of

    them and the jurist concerning the right of them.  
</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">
While couched in the language of the sixteenth century, the

distinction is not foreign to us. In the Preface to the Third

Edition, Althusius elaborates on this by elaborating on the

relationship between political science and theology through his

emphasis on the role of the Decalogue.<P><BR>



<H3><CENTER>                  Polity and Political Economy
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Althusius' polity is one that is built from the beginning on a

political economy since so many of the civil private associations

that he has in mind are basically occupational in character.

Nevertheless, he does separate politics and economics (pp.

26-27).  </p><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    So therefore economics and politics differ greatly as the

    subject and end.  The subject of the former is the good of

    the family; its end is the acquisition of whatever is

    necessary for food and clothing.  The subject of the latter,

    namely politics, is pious and just symbiosis; its end is the

    governing and preserving of association and symbiotic life.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">

In posing this definition it should be noted that Althusius

deliberately rejects the notion that economics is exclusively

private and politics exclusively public.  At least with regard to

politics, it is also private.  The linkage of the two is to be

found in the fact that symbiotic communication or sharing

involves things or goods, services and rights or lawful

structures (pp. 14 passim).
</p><p align="justify">

Throughout each of the five arenas of association, the civil

private association is usually an economic association of one

kind or another which nevertheless requires political order

within it as well as to be part of the political order of the

three public associations.  In the relationship between the

public associations and the economy, a city has responsibility

both for regulating economic life and for providing the public

infrastructure necessary for economic life (pp. 42-43).  The

province has the responsibility for the support of commercial

activity and the care of the public good of the province (p. 48)

and also to the education and training of "merchants, farmers,

and workmen who are skilled, industrious and distinguished" (p.

56).</p><p align="justify">


The commonwealth, following the fifth commandment, is charged

with the responsibility of protecting the system's goods, their

use and ownership (p. 76).  Althusius understands this as

involving not only a citizen's goods, but also his safety and

good name, all of which are viewed as property not to be stolen

(p. 75).  The commonwealth is also charged with the regulation of

commerce and contracts, and is responsible for providing an

adequate system of coinage (pp. 79-80).  In this respect, the

commonwealth is charged with overseeing the means necessary for

procuring advantages for social life (pp. 170 passim).
</p><p align="justify">

While Althusius does not directly concern himself with what we

today define as the problem of individual rights, as in the

Bible, individuals are recognized in his system by their

uniqueness, godliness, and individual moral responsibility.

Government, for Althusius, as for the Bible, is concerned

primarily with justice, though the question is left open as to

how much it is concerned with holiness or morality.  If we can

summarize Biblical and Althusian thought on the matter, public

associations must give due recognition to piety, holiness and

morality, but should go easy on efforts to do more than be

exhortative in those spheres.  In other words, they should make

clear what the standards are but should limit their role as God's

policemen.  Liberty is protected by the rejection of the reified

state and statism, and the emphasis in its place on the compound

of associations, the separation of powers, and on right

procedures.
</p><p align="justify">





Modern federalism, invented by the United States, operates
essentially on a Madisonian model which, although itself derived
from a variety of sources, draws its conception of civil society
from Lockean individualism.  Hence Madisonian federalism is based
on the idea that polities are comprised first and foremost of
individuals who combine themselves into peoples out of choice,
establishing political institutions in the process by means of
political covenants and constitutions.  While the Madisonian
model has much to teach all those embarked on federal
experiments, particularly with regard to how a polity should be
modeled in the first place as a matrix of substantially
independent cells linked through a common communications network
rather than as a power pyramid or a polity with a power center
and periphery, it has its limits in addressing federal
experiments built upon pre-existing states, nationalities, or
other primordial groups with strong identities. Indeed, it is the
persistence of those primordial groups which contributed mightily
to the failure of the modern state system invented in Europe in
the seventeenth century that pushed Althusian ideas out of sight.
The modern state system was to be centralized because each state
was to be a nation-state, a state of a single nation.
Unfortunately for the theory, the reality was such that the
primordial groups refused to disappear, often in the face of the
most extraordinary pressures directed against them by the state
builders.  
</p><p align="justify">
The collapse of the old state system has reawakened popular ties
to those groups throughout Europe as well as the rest of the
world.  Hence, they too must be considered in developing federal
responses to current political problems.  The European Community
is a case-in-point.  With all of Europe's new concern for the
individual and his or her rights, Europeans do not come to
polity-building culturally naked.  They have recognized that any
successful political solution for Europe needs to be built on a
more complex model than that of the United States.  Such a model
may indeed be available for them in the federal theory of
Althusius, precisely because he was one of those on the eve of
the modern epoch who tried to foster federal as distinct from
statist solutions on the Continent.
</p><p align="justify">
The Althusian model directly addresses the complexities of the
multi-national situations, taking into consideration families and
primordial groups as well as formal political institutions,
corporations as well as territorial units.  In his Politics, he
methodically constructs a compound republic or federal system
that is both territorial and consociational. Moreover it is one
that can accommodate four or five arenas of territorial
governance instead of two or three, the accepted number in modern
federations.  For example, at least three of the EC member
states, Belgium, Germany, and Spain, are themselves federations
and other are decentralized unions with three (or four) arenas of
governance.  For them the European community is a fourth (or a
fifth).</p><p align="justify">

Althusius had the misfortune of publishing his great work at the
very beginning of the seventeenth century, just at the time when
his compatriots were turning towards statism. In the ensuing
struggle over the direction of European state-building in the
seventeenth century, the Althusian view which called for building
of states on federal principles, as compound political
associations, lost to the view of Jean Bodin and the statists who
called for the establishment of reified centralized states where
all powers were lodged in a divinely-ordained king at the top of
the power pyramid or in a sovereign center.  While Althusian
thought had its exponents until the latter part of the century,
after that it subsequently disappeared.  It remained for the
Americans to invent modern federalism on the basis of modern
individualism and thus reintroduce the idea of the state as a
political association rather than a reified entity.</p><p align="justify">

In the nineteenth century, one party of German thinkers seeking
the unification of Germany on federal principles and led by Otto
von Gierke, rediscovered Althusius.  There, too, however,
Germany's movement toward reified statehood and finally
totalitarianism left Althusian ideas out in the cold.
</p><p align="justify">
Althusian ideas remained peripheral even to students of modern
federalism since modern federalism, was so strongly connected
with the principle of individualism that there was no need to
consider the Althusian effort to deal with the problems of
family, occupation, and community along with individual rights in
establishing political order.  Only recently, as we have come to
see the limits of unrestrained individualism, both
philosophically and practically, have political scientists begun
to explore problems of liberty in relation to primordial groups
-- families, ethnic communities and the like.  Here it was
discovered that Althusius had much to offer contemporary society.</p><p align="justify">

Martin Buber was perhaps the first to suggest how Althusian ideas
could serve twentieth century man, in part basing his political
works on Althusius.  At the very beginning of his classic study
of the Israeli kibbutz as a model for the reconstruction of
society along cooperative lines, Buber described the proper
social order as a consociatio consociationum, deliberately
selecting Althusius' formulation as the starting point from which
to develop his own realistic utopia.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

Carl Friedrich, the great academic exponent of German liberalism,
revived academic interest in Althusius with his publication of
the Politics in its Latin version with an extensive introduction.
More recently, various scholars such as Frederick Carney, Patrick
Reilly, and Thomas Heuglin have explored Althusius' ideas.  In
his native Germany there has been a renewed interest in Althusian
ideas as a foundation for German federal democracy.
</p><p align="justify">
In Yugoslavia, Althusian influence has been a powerful
counterweight to Communism as the basis for introducing a measure
of republican liberty. In 1973, I interviewed Professor Jovan
Djordjevic, the doyen of Yugoslav political scientists, a close
associate of Marshall Tito, and author of the various Yugoslav
and republic constitutions during the first three decades of the
present Yugoslav regime. In our discussion, Professor Djordjevic
indicated how much the construction of that regime had been
influenced by Althusian ideas and models.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

Somewhere between Buber's utopian vision and the effort to
concretize Althusian models in Yugoslavia is the theory of
consociationalism developed by Arend Lipjhart, Gerhard Lembruch,
and others.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT>  Borrowing that distinctively Althusian term, the
consociational theorists attempted to explain what is in effect a
non-territorial federal division of powers that constitutes a
democratic alternative to either Jacobin or majoritarian
democracy and to demonstrate how that model has been applied in
countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria
and Israel, among others.  Studies of consociational democracy in
action have repeatedly demonstrated that consociational
arrangements work best and are longest-lived where they are
combined with territorial federalism, in other words where both
dimensions of the Althusian solution grand design are present.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT><P><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                          A Summing Up
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

There is some dispute among scholars regarding the relationship
between Althusius and federalism.  Otto von Gierke, the first
scholar to try to restore Althusius to his rightful place in the
history of political thought, saw him as essentially a
medievalist, seeking to reconstruct medieval corporatism for a
post-medieval and changing time.  Carl Friedrich, on the other
hand, the most important figure in the twentieth century
Althusian revival, viewed Althusius as the forerunner of modern
federalism.  Today, Patrick Reilly and to some extent Thomas
Heuglin follow the Gierkian approach, while Frederick Carney and
this writer follow that of Friedrich.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

I would suggest that it is necessary to look to Althusius not
only in historical perspective as a transitional figure from
medieval corporatism to modern federalism, but as a source of
ideas and models for a post-modern federalism.  Pre-modern
federalism had a strong tribal or corporatist foundation, one in
which individuals were inevitably defined as members of
permanent, multi- generational groups and whose rights and
obligations derived entirely or principally from group
membership.  Modern federalism broke away from this model to
emphasize polities built strictly or principally on the basis of
individuals and their rights, allowing little or no space for
recognition or legitimation of intergenerational groups.</p><p align="justify">

A post-modern federalism must reckon with one of the basic
principles of post-modern politics, namely that individuals are
to be secured in their individual rights, yet groups are also to
be recognized as real, legitimate, and requiring an appropriate
status. Althusius is the first, and one of the few political
philosophers who has attempted to provide for this synthesis.
Needless to say, his late-medieval thought cannot be transposed
whole into the post-modern epoch in the latter part of the
twentieth century.  But in part because he wrote in a period of
epochal transition from the late-medieval to the modern epoch,
much of his system, its ideas, and even its terminology, may be
adaptable or at least form the basis for a post-modern
federalism.  
</p><p align="justify">
Here we can only outline some of the salient points in Althusius'
thought.</p><p align="justify">

1) The foundations of Althusius' political philosophy are
covenantal through and through.  Pactum is the only basis for
legitimate political organization.  More than that, Althusius
develops a covenantal-federal basis that is comprehensive.  Not
only is the universal association constructed as a federation of
communities, but politics as such is federal through and through,
based as it is on union and communication (in the sense of
sharing) as expressed in the idea that its members are symbiotes.

</p><p align="justify">
Althusius' dual emphasis on federalism as a relationship and on
sharing as the basis of federal relationships has turned out to
be a basic axiom of federalism.  While there can be different
forms of a federal relationship and sharing can be expressed in
different ways, federalism remains essentially a relationship and
sharing its guiding principle.  The polity, then, is a symbiotic
association based upon symbiosis and constituted by symbiotes.</p><p align="justify">

2) Althusius deals with the problem of sovereignty, then becoming
the critical juridical problem for modern state-building, by
vesting it in the people as a whole.  On one hand this is what
makes the good polity a res publica or commonwealth.  On the
other it also makes it possible to be a <I>consociatio
consociationum,</I> a universitas composed of <I>collegia,</I> since the
people can delegate the exercise of sovereign power to different
bodies as they please (according to their sovereign will).  
</p><p align="justify">

The problem of indivisible sovereignty raised by Jean Bodin
became the rock upon which pre-modern federalism foundered.  The
modern state system was based on the principle of indivisible
sovereignty which in an age of increasingly monolithic and
energetic states became a sin qua non for political existence.
Thus the medieval world of states based on shared sovereignty had
to give way.  It was not until the American founders invented
modern federalism that a practical solution to this problem was
found enabling the development of modern federation as a form of
government.  Althusius provided the theoretical basis for dealing
with the sovereignty question over 175 years earlier (no doubt
unbeknownst to them) and gave it the necessary philosophic
grounding.
</p><p align="justify">
Althusius further understands political sovereignty as the
constituent power.  This is at once a narrower, more republican
definition of sovereignty whose plenary character is harnessed as
the power to constitute government -- a power which is vested in
the organic body of the commonwealth, i.e., the people. Moreover,
once the people act, the sovereignty is located in the jus regni,
the fundamental right/law of the realm or the constitution.  
</p><p align="justify">
This Althusian concept has important implications in contemporary
international law which is grappling with the problem of how to
mitigate the effects of the principle of absolute and undivided
sovereignty inherited from modern jurisprudence in an
increasingly interdependent world.  Even where the principle is
not challenged, the practical exercise of absolute sovereignty is
not longer possible.  There are an increasing number of
situations in which even the principle cannot be applied as it
was.  One way out in such cases has been to vest sovereignty in
the constitutional document itself, that is to say, in what
Althusius would refer to as the jus regni. Vesting sovereignty in
a constitutional document is entirely consonant with a covenantal
federalism.
</p><p align="justify">
3) Althusius serves as a bridge between the biblical foundations
of Western civilization and modern political ideas and
institutions.  As such he translates the biblical political
tradition into useful modern forms.  In this he must be
contrasted with Spinoza who a few years later in his <I>Theological
Political Tractate</I> makes the case for a new modern political
science by presumably demonstrating that biblical political ideas
applied only to ancient Israel and ceased to be relevant once the
Jews lost their state (unless and until the Jews were restored).
Althusius confronts the same problems of modern politics without
jettisoning or denying the biblical foundations.  In part this
rendered him less useful during the modern epoch when his
unbending Calvinist emphasis on the necessary links between
religion, state and society in the form of twinned civil and
ecclesistical jurisdictions fell afoul of the development of the
modern secular state.  
</p><p align="justify">
The Althusian version of the Calvinist model of the religiously
homogeneous polity is not likely to be revived in the post-modern
epoch.  Nevertheless, we are beginning to recover an old
understanding that no civil society can exist without some basis
in transcendent norms which obligate and bind the citizens and
establish the necessary basis for trust and communication. The
connection between the Decalogue and jus as both law and right,
while hardly original to Althusius, may offer possibilities for
renewed development in our times.  Althusius adopts a
conventional understanding of the two tables of the Decalogue of
his time, namely that the first table addresses itself to piety
and the second to justice, both of which are necessary
foundations for civil society.
</p><p align="justify">
4) Very important in this connection is Althusius' development of
the concept of jus regni, which he derives explicitly from the
biblical mishpat hamelukhah (law of the kingdom), enunciated in I
Samuel 10, to serve as constitution of the universal association,
at one and the same time establishing the constitution as a civil
rather than a religious document, yet one which has its source in
or at least is in harmony with divine and natural law.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT>  While
contemporary political scientists emphasize the secular character
of modern constitutionalism, examination of most contemporary
constitutions reveals that they reflect the same combination of
claims, namely linkage to transcendent law, more often divine
than natural, yet human artifacts that are civil in character.
While in recent years we have made considerable advances in
developing an understanding of constitutional design, in doing so
we have neglected this linkage and its implications for right law
that Althusius calls to our attention.
</p><p align="justify">
5) While Althusius was clearly a product of his times and the
ideal state of his design is one which reflects the class and
reference group structure of sixteenth century German society, it
is significant that Althusius leaves open the possibility for
democracy as we know it, including female participation in public
life and office-holding, and a more classless and egalitarian
basis for participation generally.  Since I do not have a
sufficient command of the Latin text to properly explore the
issue, I cannot say whether Althusius has an esoteric as well as
an exoteric teaching, but this suggests that there may be a
hidden dimension to be explored in the <I>Politics</I> and Althusian
thought generally.  Nor is the federal aspect insignificant here.
Althusius suggests different forms and extents of participation
in the different arenas of government as one possible way to
extend participation in public life to groups heretofore
disenfranchised in the world that he knew.  
</p><p align="justify">
A contemporary Althusian politics should address itself to the
same possibilities; for example, somewhat indirect democracy
for international institutions and republican or representative
government for what Althusius would have called provincial and we
would call state, land, or cantonal institutions, and for the
universal association or general government.
</p><p align="justify">
6) Althusius recognizes the modern distinction between public and
private realms, yet also preserves the connection between them.
In this respect, he, like the moderns who were to follow him,
breaks with classic notions of the all-embracing polis to
recognize the legitimacy of a sphere of private activity that
exists constitutionally by right, thereby preventing
totalitarianism. Yet he recognizes the connection between the
simple and private dissociations of family and collegium and the
mixed and public associations of city, province and commonwealth.
Indeed the relationship between private and public spheres and
associations is a major concern of his as it is increasingly to
those of us who must reckon with the realities of the post-modern
epoch in which everything is tied into everything else, like it
or not.</p><p align="justify">

One of the advantages of the modern epoch was that it was
possible to more sharply separate the public and private spheres
because the modern epoch was one in which increased distance
between them was possible.  Since this is no longer the case, the
new commonwealth requires more Althusian communication, that is
to say, as everything impinges upon everything else, more sharing
is necessary.  Althusius' emphasis on the existence of both
natural and civil associations in the private sphere reflects his
emphasis on what we would call the natural right of association.
The family is a natural association based on two relationships:
conjugal and kinship.  Since the nuclear family is a conjugal
relationship, even it is covenantal.  The collegium or civil
association in both its secular and ecclesiastical forms is
covenantal.  
</p><p align="justify">
Mixed and public associations are equally covenantal: the
city is a covenantal republic formed of a union of collegia, the
province a covenantal union of cities, and the commonwealth a
covenantal union of provinces (this is so even though Althusius
talks of the rights of the province as an arm of the commonwealth
and not simply a union of cities).  Covenants for Althusius are
the ways in which symbiotes can initiate and maintain
associations.  They are products of both necessity and volition.</p><p align="justify">

7) Althusius' definition of politics as the effective ordering of
communication (of things, services and rights) offers us a
starting point for understanding political phenomena that speaks
to contemporary political science.  This leads us to the second
half of Althusian thought: that dealing with statesmanship,
prudence and administration.  It would be possible to say that
the second half of Althusian teaching is general to all of
politics and not specifically to federalism, except that this
would do violence to the first half of Althusian teaching which
sees all politics as federal politics in the broadest sense.
</p><p align="justify">
It should be clear that Althusius directly addresses the issues
that surround the relationship between collective organization
and individual liberty and the role of rules or constitutions in
constituting and constraining collective organizations and
constraining and protecting individual liberty.  First of all, in
the manner of contemporary public choice theorists, Althusius
reduces the distinctions between private and public associations
to those of function and scope rather than essence (essentially
following the biblical view of the matter).  For Althusius,
following the biblical model, the constituting rules governing
collective organizations and the relations among them are
embodied in covenants, which also serve to ground liberty in the
rules themselves.  Covenants are made among the symbiotes to
initiate and maintain all associations.  Universal association is
further served by the jus regni as its constitution.  The jus
regni is explicitly derived from the biblical mishpat hamelukhah
and indeed is a translation of that term.  For Althusius, as for
the Bible, the jus regni is the civil constitutional law derived
from the Decalogue.<P><BR>
