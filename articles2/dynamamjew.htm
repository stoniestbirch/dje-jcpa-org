          <p align="justify">

     The meeting was arranged by the US Embassy Cultural Affairs
 Officer as the centerpiece of their programming for me in China.
 The CAO had come to understand that Jewish topics were of interest
 to the Institute so, even though it was not listed on my formal
 list of topics, he suggested it to them and they grabbed it.  My
 invitation to China grew out of their request.</p><p align="justify">


 The meeting itself was quite closed and included only a selected
 group from the Institute --those involved in the Christian Studies
 Program, of which Judaism is a part.  While it is impossible to
 know exactly, I have the impression that only members of the
 Program were invited.  Indeed, that explains my strange meeting
 with Professor Zhao on Tuesday.  Zhao, who is a Vice President of
 the Academy and the senior person in Christian Studies, indicated
 both to the USIA people and myself that he was not planning to be
 at the presentation, without offering any excuse or apology.  I
 wondered about that, but the way that the meeting was handled may
 have explained it.</p><p align="justify">


 The meeting was presided over by Professor Gao Wangzhi, the
 director of Christian Studies.  He was clearly the senior man
 present, and with the possible exception of the man responsible
 for studies of the Orthodox Church, had no competition in the
 room. The others were all subordinates -- younger people within
 the institute, his of research assisstants, librarians, etc. There
 were also three people from the Academy's Foreign Affairs
 Department present, a man who left before the end, a young woman
 who took copious notes, and the interpreter, who struggled
 valiantly to interpret ideas and concepts foreign to her.  There
 were eight or nine Chinese present from the Institute.  Professor
 Gao dominated the proceedings, though not unpleasantly.  He
 introduced me without giving any of my credentials, even less than
 were given on Monday by Professor Li at the Academy's Institute of
 American Studies.  He did not mention my institutional
 affiliations or anything, merely turned the floor over to me after
 a few general comments about how pleased they were to have me with
 them.</p><p align="justify">


 I spoke through the interpreter in consecutive interpretation.
 The interpreter, who struggled with my words, knew English
 moderately well, but not really well enough to interpret since
 there were many relatively common words that she did not
 understand.  Her efforts were supplemented by Professor Gao and by
 Bena Camp, the ACAO present, who was of great help, both in
 checking the accuracy of the translation and in filling in missing
 words.  The  major problem was simply conceptual.  Concepts like
 "voluntary", "republican", and "federal" are simply not found in
 the Chinese lexicon.  In fact, one of the strongest impressions I
 came away with was the degree to which the lack of any tradition
 of what we would call in the West democratic republicanism is
 crucial to even conveying our political ideas to the Chinese. They
 simply have no framework within which to place them and at best
 can think of them as utter abstractions.  Needless to say, I had
 to simplify my talk a great deal in order to convey even the few
 basic points that I wished to convey.
</p><p align="justify">

 At least two people in addition to Gao Wanghzi did listen intently
 -- a young lady researcher and one of the librarians, also a lady,
 who was responsible for dealing with the terms related to Judaism
 in the dictionary of religions they are publishing.  The young
 lady researcher was really from the editorial department
 responsible for the publication of their journal.  These two women
 seemed very interested in Judaism as a subject.</p><p align="justify">


 The researcher responsible for Orthodox Christianity may have been
 a bit hostile.  There was a young archeologist who was interested
 in a vague way, perhaps because he was hard put to formulate
 questions (at one point he asked me "What about American Jewish
 youth?").  The others asked questions with varying degrees of
 interest or understanding.  I would say that all were, at least,
 moderately interested in the topic. Apparently, the only other
 speaker on Judaism that they have had was Rabbi Joshua Stampfer of
 Portland, Oregon who gave one talk several years ago after he was
 found by happenstance by Gao while on a private visit to China.
</p><p align="justify">

 The questions they asked were good, if quite general.  Obviously,
 they were in no position to go into much detail on a subject so
 foreign to them, although the lady from the editorial staff had
 read items on Jewish life in the United States in Time and was
 able to ask me about the "National Jewish Committee" (apparently,
 the American Jewish Committee) and the Jewish lobby in a
 sufficiently focused way for me to give detailed answers.  The
 student of the Orthodox Church started by asking me a pointed
 question as to how many Jews there were in the world and in the
 United States.  Most of the other questions were less direct --
 the vaguest being from the young archeologist who asked about
 Jewish youth in the United States and is there any place where
 ancient Jewish remains are found?</p><p align="justify">


 I emphasized that the Jews are a world civilization as ancient as
 the Chinese; a small, but influential people whose influence comes
 from being located at the center of every important communications
 network in the world beginning with Eretz Israel at the crossroads
 of Europe, Asia and Africa.  I emphasized the relationship between
 Israel and the diaspora and how Jews were different from the
 Chinese because of the dominant role played by the diaspora for so
 long, how Jewish existence in the diaspora necessitated portable
 organization (a concept they could not understand easily) with a
 provision for expressing all three dimensions wherever Jews found
 themselves.  I then broke down the dimensions of Jewish existence
 into the Torah-as-constitution, <I>halakhah</I> as the law, organization
 and institutions, explaining that the Torah and its accretions
 represented the constitution.  I did not elaborate on the
 accretions.  (The librarian in a comment revealing the problem of
 translation of terms, indicated that she tried to find a
 translation for the term Talmud in English or Russian and could
 not find either.  In both cases, the word Talmud was used and she
 wanted to know why).</p><p align="justify">

 With regard to law, I emphasized the idea of halakha as way and
 the existence of a Jewish way of life.  In connection with
 organization, I emphasized that the Jewish community was
 republican and egalitarian.  They may have understood egalitarian
 but they had a hard time with republican.  Bea had to fish around
 for the proper Chinese word.  I indicated my surprise, considering
 that China is called the People's Republic of China in English,
 but apparently the Chinese word for republic is not exactly
 "republic," but rather something like a public group
 (collective?).
</p><p align="justify">

 With regard to institutions, I talked mostly about Knesset-Israel
 and bet knesset as a congregation, which I was able to convey to
 them since it was a term they seemed to understand.
</p><p align="justify">

 I went on to discuss how modernization has transformed the Jews,
 again trying to suggest a parallel with China; how the major
 feature of modernization was the adandonment of Jewish autonomy
 and the acquisition of citizenship in their countries of residence
 by individual Jews, on the one hand, and the restoration of Jewish
 statehood on the other hand.  I was going to talk to them about
 civil religion and state-diaspora relations in more detail but saw
 no way to communicate anything about those two concepts so I went
 instead to the organizational principles today, namely how the
 Torah has been reinterpreted as constitution, how most Jews no
 longer live strictly according to the halakha but have found
 modifications, that organization is federal and voluntary with
 Israel at the center of concern, and that institutions vary from
 country to country.  I then described the institutions of US Jewry
 by describing each of their five spheres:
 religious-congregational, educational-cultural, communal-welfare,
 community relations, and Israel-overseas.
</p><p align="justify">

 I made many references to Israel, trying to emphasize all the time
 how important Israel is in the Jewish scheme of things.  No one
 asked me a question about Israel nor did they refer to Israel
 directly.  The closest that anyone came was Gao Wangzhzi who
 mentioned the United States and "other countries" with "other
 countries" clearly referring to Israel.  He also congratulated us
 on the revival of the Hebrew language, which drew murmurs of
 approval.  It was extremely obvious that they were avoiding
 mention of Israel but were aware of it.
</p><p align="justify">

 One questioner suggested that Jews in the United States were very
 powerful (I believe it was the editorial person).  I suggested
 that this was the case and that they used their power to work with
 other Americans to improve the quality of American life, to
 support Israel, and to work for other Jewish concerns such as
 Soviet Jewry and Ethiopian Jewry.  They listened, but gave no
 further response.  I talked about the Soviet Jewry struggle and
 the exodus of Ethiopian Jews to Israel and how American Jewry
 helped.  I talked about American Jewish fundraising for local,
 overseas, and Israel purposes.</p><p align="justify">


 I talked a great deal about Jewish education.  Indeed, there were
 many questions about Hebrew as a language, Yiddish and Yiddish
 literature.  Gao asked about Yiddish and its rich literature (his
 words), obviously, to show off that he knew something about it.
 This enabled me to explain the whole question of Jewish languages
 and the importance of the revival of Hebrew, which they
 congratulated us on succeeding to revive.  I also explained the
 importance of studying classical texts and how Jewish
 egalitarianism required that all Jews study the same basic texts
 and that any Jew who knew Hebrew could do so, which impressed
 them.  They drew parallels with classical Chinese texts which can
 only be studied by scholars.</p><p align="justify">


 Another questioner, whom I also thought was a bit hostile, asked
 me to indicate what Judaism and Jews had contributed to the United
 States.  My guess is that he was thinking in the back of his mind,
 "Why should Americans be so concerned about Israel and why should
 Jews be so powerful there when they are so few in number?"  I
 responded by dividing the question into three parts; dealing with
 Judaism as an influence on American society; the role of the
 organized Jewish community, and the role of individual Jews. I
 began by emphasizing how Christianity emerged out of Judaism was a
 daughter religion and that those Christians who founded the United
 States were particularly close to their Jewish roots so that
 American society is much influenced by the Bible.  I then
 discussed the Jewish contribution to the civil rights struggle and
 to the development of voluntary organizations in the United
 States, and then I talked about how individual Jews had made
 important contributions as Americans.  Gao Wanghzi tried to
 reenforce that point by mentioning that Einstein was Jewish and
 Brandeis was Jewish and a few other names were thrown out by
 others -- Einstein seems to be a particularly well known name.</p><p align="justify">


 The man who studies the Orthodox Church then asked me a question
 about the Holocaust.  Why did the Germans choose the Jews?  There
 was a big discussion about the Holocaust with Gao Wanghzi
 mentioning the fact that there is no anti-Semitism in China.  This
 got us on to the question of the Jews in China, particularly those
 of Kaifeng.  Gao described his own research and how he had
 identified the 100 families that were still aware of their Jewish
 ancestry, but were no longer Jews, having assimilated into China
 because of the lack of anti-Semitism.</p><p align="justify">


 He did not see any of them coming back to Judaism, though he did
 see the possibility of erecting a museum to the Jewish community
 there.  There was no possibility of reconstructing the synagogus
 since there is now a hospital on the site and, moreover, the
 original synagogue was grand and the Jews or descendants of Jews
 there could not afford to rebuild it.  I asked him about the
 Jewish communities in China and he mentioned a number of other
 places where Jews had lived but said that there are no real
 records for studying the communities so he does not have data, he
 only knows of the fact that there were such communities.  He also
 mentioned the Jewish refugees in Shanghai but did not mention any
 other city.  When I mentioned Harbin and Tsiensin, he more or less
 nodded his head but did not know much about it.
</p><p align="justify">

 He and Zhao are the two professors in China who write about Jewish
 matters.  He gave me an article of his in Chinese about the
 origins of the Jewish people, published in the Institute's
 journal. The book on the <I>Jews of China</I> by Sidney Shapiro was
 published in New York and is barely available in China.  He and
 Zhao have copies. The Foreign Press Service Bookstore does not
 even know about it. Sidney Shapiro apparently wrote the book
 because Jews kept looking him up and asking him questions about
 the Jews of China about which he knew no answers, so he followed
 up matters and wrote the book. Gao contributed an original
 chapter.  There is one professor of Hebrew at the Protestant
 Seminary in Nanjing -- an older man who apparently was trained in
 the language outside of China.</p><p align="justify">


 The Holocaust seems to be a matter of some modest interest and
 something they know more about than anything else.  Apparently,
 China television has acquired the Holocaust series or are about to
 and are preparing to show it, according to Gao Wanghzi. They also
 asked about intermarriage in the United States.  Again, what they
 seem to know about is what they follow in Time and Newsweek.  The
 two women in auxiliary positions, who read as part of their
 responsibilities, seem to know more than the men who are the
 researchers.
