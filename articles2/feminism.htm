<p align="justify">

 Marie Syrkin's article, written by a woman who did not need the
 women's liberation movement to open the doors for her great
 accomplishments in life, has written a senstivie piece reflecting
 the perplexities of women's liberation for a truly liberated woman
 in the best sense. Perhaps some of the answers to the questions
 she poses lie in her own statement.</p><p align="justify">

 In Marie Syrkin's case, as in the case of Golda Meir, her good
 friend and classic example, Zionism, the Jewish national movement,
 was, indeed, the source of their liberation, a true liberation,
 not merely the pursuit of private gratifications, which are no
 better when pursued by women for presumably ideological reasons
 than when pursued by men for less noble ones.  Meir and Syrkin
 achieved because they were committed to Jewish national needs.
 They had a cause to which they committed themselves and which
 brought out their substantial talents.</p><p align="justify">

 Now that so many goals of the women's movement have been attained,
 the time has come to clarify those goals, to separate out those
 which are really demands for the right of self-indulgence and
 those which are demands for the right of partnership and
 achievement.  Is there a conflict between feminism and the
 national survival of the Jewish people?  To the extent that
 feminism pursues individual self-indulgence the answer is yes, but
 that is as much true for every other form of individual
 self-indulgence.  All people, men and women, once they commit
 themselves to a larger cause must give up some of their individual
 desires.  Not only women must assume responsibilities that they
 may or may not have chosen had they been concerned only with their
 own passions (for that is what we are talking about:  passions,
 not needs in any objective sense).</p><p align="justify">

 Thus, the feminist question is really a larger question as to
 whether any national cause or, for that matter, any other cause
 that requires collective effort is worth the sacrifice of
 individual desires.  Those of us who see Jewish national needs as
 central to our lives know what the answer has to be, nor is that
 simply a matter of personal preference, as the other side could
 easily argue:  "Fine, you choose to surbordinate your individual
 desires to national needs, that is your choice.  But if someone
 chooses personal gratification, that is theirs."  We would argue,
 I believe quite accurately, that the pursuit of individual
 passions ends up, in the last analysis, to be empty and
 unsatisfying.  It is only in commitment to something larger than
 oneself that one fulfills one's real needs and achieves truly
 human dimensions.  It is sad, if not surprising, that the initial
 thrust of American feminism has gotten the two confused.  Sad,
 because it leads away from fulfillment, but not surprising, given
 the trend to radical individualism and paganism in contemporary
 American society, which has emphasized the gratification of
 individual passions, no matter what.</p><p align="justify">

 The real womens' libbers were the Zionist pioneers whom Prof.
 Syrkin describes.  They were not concerned with demanding the
 right of self-indulgence, or even individual careerist
 achievement, but the right to share in the same tasks of national
 rebuilding as the men.  What Prof. Syrkin describes as the result
 of their experience, a "regression" to women's roles, should be
 instructive to us all.  Israel is, in many respects, a post-lib
 society where the right to equality has long been established (the
 day that the United States has the same percentage of women doc-
 tors and lawyers as Israel is still a way off, I would guess).</p><p align="justify">

 Hence, Israeli women, certainly those from the groups that passed
 through the women's lib stage, are appropriate models for learning
 where biology does win out, not to speak of national need.</p><p align="justify">

 All the women in my circles in Israel pursue careers which they
 have chosen (at least as much as it is possible to choose in
 Israel, for men or women), ranging from traditional women's
 careers in education to contractor (my wife), yet all have
 children -- most, three or more -- and are not worried about
 having to maintain households.  Some, indeed, have chosen
 home-making as a career, apparently without the hangups
 confronting the recent generation of feminists in the United
 States.</p><p align="justify">

 Since we are all religiously observant, all of us, men and women,
 share a commitment to the limits which that observance imposes
 upon us.  I am confident that my women friends have made choices,
 even hard choices, when it comes to questions of career and
 family, but so have their husbands.  Every one of them could live
 outside of Israel, make far more money, rise to equal if not
 greater eminence in even larger ponds than this one, and not have
 such burdens as military reserve duty and super-heavy taxation.
 Many of us who came from the diaspora gave up much of that.
 Obviously, for those whose whole philosophy is summed up in such
 phrases as "you only live once," we are all fools.  On the other
 hand, there are those of us who believe that precisely because you
 only live once, one's life needs to be given real meaning and that
 comes from linking with a cause larger than one's self.</p><p align="justify">

 It is certainly easier for American men and women to avoid
 confronting this problem.  American society is so big that one
 hardly feels the same sense of urgency that the little Jewish
 people and its even smaller segment in Israel must articulate,
 particularly in the aftermath of the Holocaust, but the imperative
 of limiting self-indulgence for the sake of national need is no
 less in the United States.  Indeed, it is a civilizational need
 that is shared by the entire Western world.</p><p align="justify">

 It may not seem to the young American women deciding not to have
 children that her decision has any effect on the future of
 civilization.  But in a world in which the West is a minority and
 has now become a kind of decadent elite, declining demographically
 as well as losing its will to survive, there are indeed barbarians
 waiting in the wings to inherit us.  Even the best of them offer a
 way of life which is, in most respects, the antithesis of Western
 values, including most of the values which the feminists espouse,
 beyond those of feminine self-indulgence.  For those of us who
 have children and thus have made a commitment to the continuation
 of our human race and our civilization, it is a frightening
 prospect that the freedoms we cherish are likely to go under for
 sheer  demographic failure.  This may not concern people who have
 decided that their only obligation is to themselves and they have
 to do  nothing to continue the species.  In my opinion there is no
 justification whatsoever for that attitude, feminist or any
 other.</p><p align="justify">

 Footnote:  One word on Marie Syrkin's interpretation of the
 celebrated "woman of valor" passage from the Book of Proverbs. A
 husband sitting at the gates of the city with the elders of the
 land is biblical idiom for engaging in governance.  That may be
 even more sexist than her understanding that he is sitting there
 in idleness, or perhaps in study.  But he is not being idle but
 engaging in what the author of that passage may see as man's work,
 although the Bible itself has at least exceptional women
 participating in that work as well.
