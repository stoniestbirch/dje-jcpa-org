<p align="justify">
 Jews often treat "Christian attitudes" toward them and their state
 as if those attitudes were of a piece, internally
 undifferentiated.  In fact, Christian attitudes differ by
 religious denomination, ethnicc background, socio-economic status,
 and, in the United States, even geographic location.
 Understanding these differences is vital for the development of
 appropriate strategies in Jewish attempts to relate to Christian
 groups and to mobilize Christian influence in public policy issues
 of concern to Israel in particular and to the Jewish people in
 general.
</p><p align="justify">
 In 1984, Stuart Rothenberg and Frank Newport conducted a
 countrywide survey in which they attempted to identify and define
 the Evangelical voter and analyze his voting patterns.  The survey
 was conducted under the auspices of the Institute for Government
 and Politics of the Free Congress Research and Education
 Foundation and the results were published in a volume entitled <I>The
 Evangelical Voter: Religion and Politics in America. </I> Although
 Rothenberg and Newport focus strictly on the Evangelical vote,
 they collected a large bocy of data not used in their book which
 dealt more specifically with the attitudes toward Jews and Israel
 of non-fundamentalist Christian groups as well.  These data offer
 us an opportunity to examine the geo-demographic patterns of
 Christian attitudes toward Israel.</p><p align="justify">

 Upon analysis, these data point to some important convergences
 which can help guide the policy of the Jewish community in its
 external relations.
</p><BR>

                     <CENTER><H3>Attitudes Toward Israel</H3></CENTER> <p align="justify">
 With regard to their attitudes towards Israel, American Christians
 divide into three groupings: positive attitudes are displayed in
 the South proper and the Mountain and Pacific West; slightly less
 positive attitudes are found in the West South Central region; and
 the least positive attitudes are grouped in the bloc of states
 from the Northeast through the Midwest.  The West North Central
 states are ambivalent and share the low levels of "really dislike"
 characteristic of the South and West, but there are also the low
 levels of "really like" characteristic of the Northeast.
</p><p align="justify">
 This is crucial for presidential politics and in fact works to
 Jewish advantage.  Where Israel is least popular, in the New
 England, Mid-Atlantic, and East North Central states, the Jews are
 also politically the strongest because of local population
 concentrations and involvement.  Hence they are in a position to
 counterbalance public opinion with their votes.  Where it has the
 strongest support, Jews are, with the exception of Florida and
 California, somewhat less politically influential because they do
 not have the numbers or presence to be influential.  The real
 problem geographically is in the West South Central states
 meaning, in particular, Texas, where there is a softness towards
 Israel.

 This pattern is carried over in the responses of the political
 target groups.  The Conservative Republicans are by far the most
 positive and among the least negative, followed by the moderate
 liberal Democrats.  The most negative are moderate liberal
 Republicans and the Catholics, who are also more likely to be
 fencesitters on this issue.  The moderate liberal Republicans are
 mostly in the northeast and help bring down that region's overall
 positive rating, while most of the Conservative Republicans are in
 the West or, increasingly, the South.</p><BR>

 The pattern is further reinforced by denomination and type of
 church.  Again, among the least positive and by far the most
 negative are the high status denominations, most of whose members
 are probably also moderate liberal Republicans living in the
 Northeast or Midwest.  This suggests that here we have a
 convergence of upper strata genteel anti-Semitism, the economic
 interests of big business and banking interests who do not want to
 alienate the Arabs with their wealth, and contemporary liberalism
 as underdoggism which is especially characteristic of these
 archetypical "WASPS," domestically and in foreign affairs.
</p><p align="justify">
 Catholics are the second most negative group, again probably
 reflecting at least residual ethnic anti-Jewish feelings, also
 concentrated in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and East North
 Central states.  The Baptists turn out to be the most favorable,
 which correlates with the recent fundamentalist love affair for
 Israel and also among the least unfavorable, which in all
 likelihood reflects a residue of their older anti-Semitic
 predelictions. At the same time, the other conservative
 denominations are more or less in the middle.</p><p align="justify">

 The high ranking among the Lutherans cannot be explained by the
 lmited data.  They are not a group noted for pro-Israel or
 pro-Jewish feelings in the past. Obviously there is a split in
 their ranks, since they also have the third highest negative
 rating after the high status Protestant denominations and the
 Catholics.</p><BR>

 Given the configuration of presidential politics in the United
 States, this means that Israel is likely to continue to maintain
 White House support because of the convergence of constituencies,
 especially since Israel does well in the test for turnout
 propensity: the higher the turnout propensity the more favorable,
 while the most unfavorable have a low turnout propensity.  On the
 other hand, Texas and the high status Protestant eastern
 Republican establishment need particular attention.  The ethnic
 Catholics need less, for two reasons.  First, they are losing
 power and, second, the data on respondents' ages suggests that in
 any case what is likely to have caused weaknesses in their
 attitude may be diminishing in the younger generation.
</p><p align="justify">
 Overall, while there is relatively little spread with regard to
 positive attitudes towards Israel by age.  Those below the age of
 44 seem to be more positively predisposed than those above,
 indicating no decline in pro-Israel feeling among the great bulk
 of the American people.  On the other hand, those under 34 are
 also the most anti-Israel in percentages that equal those of
 between 55 and 64.  There is less neutrality among the younger
 people and more polarization.  One would guess that a lot of the
 "anti" feeling is a result of the trendy liberalism of the young.
 That could pose a problem, unless the young grow out of it.
 Obviously, it is not enough to leave things to that hope. Negative
 feelings towards Israel are at their minimum between the ages of
 35 and 54 and over the age of 65.</p><BR>

 This analysis is reinforced by the age-education correlation.
 Thus under 35 and those with no college education are more likely
 to be neutral than those over 54, while college education seems to
 increase positive responses in every age group.  No doubt this is
 a reflection of the way in which college education lessens
 culturally transmitted prejudice.  The most favorable/least
 unfavorable group by far in any of the categories dealt with so
 far in this discussion are the 35 to 54 year olds with some
 college or more.  These are the people who were raised in the
 period when prejudice was most forcefully repudiated -- during and
 after World War II, and whose impressions of Israel were
 undoubtedly formed when Israel was considered positively in almost
 every respect.  The most anti-Israel feelings were to be found
 among those under 35 with at least some college education: people
 who came of age when Israel already was considered to be an
 occupier and a denier of Palestinian civil rights, and
 anti-Zionist prejudice was becoming somewhat more acceptable. All
 in all, in looking at respondents' education, education is more
 likely to produce favorable feelings toward Israel and to reduce
 negative ones.</p><BR>

 This pattern repeats itself when the data are analyzed according
 to type of work.  Upper and lower white collar and upper blue
 collar have almost identical positive responses, substantially
 separated from lower blue collar.  However, the lower blue collar
 and upper white collar are almost equally the most anti-Israel.
 The latter, one would assume, reflect again the upper class high
 status Protestant denominations and moderate to liberal
 Republicans.

 unfavorable to Israel, with Independents more likely to be
 neutral.  Serious Christians are substantially more favorable and
 less unfavorable which, of course, is reflected in questions on
