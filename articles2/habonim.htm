</h2> </font><BR>

<p align="justify">

 I was a member of Habonim during most of the years I lived in
 Detroit -- from 1949 until 1953, that is, for my last two years of
 high school and first two of college.  I was not yet in Habonim
 when the State of Israel was established (in fact, I was in the
 hospital recovering from viral pneumonia) so I was not part of the
 initial celebration, but the new state was still a fresh
 experience for all of us.  As young people we were less engaged by
 the wonder of it than by the struggles over aliya and particularly
 over kibbutziut as distinct from mere aliya.  A number of "elders"
 in the movement rushed off to Israel in 1948 and early 1949;
 unfortunately, many of those from Detroit returned disillusioned
 two or three years later, which had its effect on us all.</p><p align="justify">


 Detroit Habonim in the late 1940s and early 1950s was on the
 fringes of radicalism in a city which was noted for its urban
 radical movements in the 1930s.  We grew up in the shadow of the
 Reuther brothers, the UAW, sitdown strikes, and militant unionism,
 and were all influenced accordingly.  We sang the right labor
 songs and were moved by them.  The Spanish Civil War was merely a
 decade before, and was still a potent factor in determining
 allegiances and attitudes.  Indeed, looking back on the period,
 the Spanish Civil War was probably a greater force in our lives
 than the Holocaust, even though Habonim itself absorbed a number
 of Holocaust survivors who had settled in Detroit.  We had
 considerable contact with the panoply of radical groups that
 existed in Detroit, not only Zionist radicals like Hashomer
 Hatzair, but Communists, Trotskyites, Socialist Labor Party
 people, and even a few surviving Wobblies.  Of course we were in
 the vanguard of the folk song revival, with Pete Seeger and the
 Weavers number one on our hit parade.</p><p align="justify">

 In some respects, my Habonim ties were an unexpected match.  I was
 a strongly committed Zionist and sought a strong and committed
 Zionist youth movement.  My earlier experiences with Young Judea
 had convinced me that a movement so much under the thumb of its
 parent organizations, particularly Hadassah, was doomed to remain
 parve; it never could take a stand on the crucial issues that
 mattered to young Zionists at the time, particularly the issue of
 aliya.  I was one of those who seceded from Young Judea in 1949
 when an effort was made to establish an American branch of Hanoar
 Hatzioni, but the effort failed and, in any case, I was the only
 member of Hanoar Hatzioni west of the Appalachians.</p><p align="justify">

 In Detroit I could not find any kindred spirits who were committed
 to intensive Zionism, without an equal commitment to Zionist
 socialism or some dimension thereof, such as the kibbutz.  There
 is, where Habonim and I diverged since I was not a socialist (not
 even then).  Labor Zionism did not hold that kind of ideological
 appeal for me.  Moreover, I was observant.  Friday nights at the
 moadon were off limits for me by my choice.  Our family spent leyl
 Shabbat together and even if we had not, the character of Shabbat
 at the moadon was not to my taste.  To compound matters, Habonim
 in those days was still closely tied to the Eastern European
 origins of most of its active members and placed a great deal of
 emphasis on Yiddish.  I, a Sephardi and Hebraist, had little
 sympathy, much less afinity, for that aspect of the movement.
 Finally, I was committed to taking my studies seriously,
 especially my Hebrew and Jewish studies, whereas my peers in
 Habonim tended to view the movement as a surrogate for serious
 Jewish study.  Nevertheless, I became a wholehearted member,
 deeply involved in Habonim affairs, and count the experience as
 one of the important formative experiences of my life.</p><p align="justify">

 I think that the success of my klita into Habonim had to do with
 the particular group which I encountered, which was somewhat
 atypical from a Habonim point of view, although it certainly
 furnished its share of leaders for the movement.  Paradoxically,
 what set it aside as special was that it was more Americanized
 than the other Habonim groups in Detroit and, from my limited
 experience with the rest of the country, most other places as well
 in those days.</p><p align="justify">

 In any case, Habonim furnished me with a hevrah in a city where I
 was notably alone.  We had moved to Detroit early in 1948 when I
 was in 9th grade, a difficult time to fit into a new school
 framework, especially one in which most of my classmates had been
 together since kindergarten.  Moreover, while over 90 percent of
 the students in the school I attended were Jewish, few had serious
 Jewish interests.  While I attended Hebrew high school and later
 the Midrasha (College of Jewish Studies), there were not many like
 me who did so and few of them were of my age or shared other
 interests with me outside of the classroom.  Thus, Habonim filled
 an important gap in my life.  While I have since lost contact with
 most of my friends of those days, the only Detroiters or former
 Detroiters with whom I have any contact are ex-Habonim members and
 my ties with the rest of the Habonim network, especially in
 Israel, if not intense, are still very real.</p><p align="justify">

 My parents were tolerant of all this, recognizing my need, but not
 encouraging.  Habonim in those days, and perhaps in others, was
 looked upon as a bit wild; young people who did not want to accept
 the discipline and learn from the experience of their elders.  We
 wanted to do everything ourselves, from building our camp (a task
 in which I took part with some relish even though I never attended
 the camp since I was not much for summer camps altogether,
 preferring to travel, and when I did attend camp, attended
 Hebrew-speaking ones), or advocating aliya in the face of an
 increasingly lethargic Labor Zionist movement, or simply in the
 way most Habonim members dressed (my group dressed more neatly, a
 point in their favor in my parents' eyes), and stayed out to all
 hours.  No doubt their attitude had some inhibiting effect on the
 depth of my involvement.  For example, they talked me out of going
 on the Habonim Workshop, since they were very opposed to any
 interruption of my studies.</p><p align="justify">

 By and large, my Habonim experience was confined to Detroit.
 However, I did maintain close contact with the group in
 Minneapolis, my native city, since I was back there frequently.
 There I played a modest leadership role, more so than in my own
 city, working closely with Jonathan Paradise who was reorganizing
 local Habonim, helping him with educational materials and
 programs.</p><p align="justify">

 By the early 1950s there was a great dampening of sentiment for
 aliya and the kibbutz in Detroit and Habonim began to grope its
 way toward different goals.  It was then that I went away to the
 University of Chicago.  In Chicago I had limited connections with
 Habonim and ex-Habonim.  I found my time absorbed by another
 network, that of my friends from Camp Ramah.
