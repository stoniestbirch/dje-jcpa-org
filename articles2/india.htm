<H3><CENTER>                   Introduction
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

 The Jewish community of India is the fourth largest Asian Jewish
 community after Israel, Asian Russia, and Iran.  In 1948, at the
 time of the founding of the State of Israel, India had a Jewish
 population of approximately 30,000.  Since then some 20,000 have
 migrated to Israel and several thousand elsewhere, leaving a
 community of seven to eight thousand, according to the official
 estimates, most of Bene' Israel origin.  No one knows for sure,
 but the lower figure is perhaps more correct.  The number has
 been stable for several years now, since the burst of aliyah
 following the Six Day War ceased.  It does not diminish because
 the birth rate replenishes the losses due to emigration.  The
 overwhelming majority of the Jews are still concentrated in Bombay
 in much the same situation as they were before.  In addition,
 there are communities in Calcutta, Delhi, Cochin, Poona and a few
 villages in Maharashton State.  There is absoulutely no pressure
 from within India itself for the exodus of the Jews.</p><p align="justify">


 India is almost unique among countires of the world in its
 attitude towards its Jews.  There is no known anti-Semititism in
 India nor are Jews looked upon as in any significant way different
 from the many Indian minority religions.  The character of Indian
 culture -- its relative placidity, its acceptance of diversity,
 and its inherent communalism -- have given the Jews a sanctuary
 the likes of which has never been known in any of the countries of
 the western world.  At the same time Indian Jewry has, perforce,
 acquired the characteristics of the Indian population in general.
 Their social patterns, psychological characteristics, and culture
 all bear the marks of the civilization within which they have been
 located for hundreds if not thousands of years.</p><p align="justify">
 In terms of the organization of the Jewish community, most of its
 institutions other than the synagogue introduced into community by
 migrants from the West during the past century and a half -- many
 more recently of them have survived in a very non-Western society
 only by virtue of a handful of leaders.  As the result, the
 communities can barely support the institutions that exist and in
 all likelihood, will be even less able to do so in the future.</p><p align="justify">

 The Central Jewish Board is the roof organization that gives the
 community an address.  It was founded during World War II by
 Victor Sassoon and others for that purpose.  While it claims
 jurisdiction over all the Jews of India, it is actually confined
 to Bombay and environs because that is where the Jews are.  The
 other communities are too far away although they ocassionally sent
 someone for a meeting.</p><p align="justify">


 19-21 January - Calcutta</p><p align="justify">

 On 19 January, when we arrived in Calcutta, we discovered that the
 USIS information service had found a Jewish confectioner who kept
 kosher and who provided us with a package dinner of chicken and
 trimmings (but later discovered that 25% of the Jewish families
 observe kashrut.  The only kosher slaughtering is of chickens.).
 The confectioner's name is Nahoum and his family owns a shop in
 the New Market.  Through him, we learned where a synagogue was
 located, which we visited the next morning (20 January).  The
 non-Jewish USIS employee who found the synagogue for us was told
 by the people in the vicinity that it is "the place of the
 Zionists".  (He, an East Bengali, has never had any knowing
 contact with Jews before so the terms simply confused him.)
</p><p align="justify">
 Magen David, the synagogue we visited, is the largest in Calcutta.
 It is located in the Old Market, along with the Portuguese and
 Armenian Churches.  According to the plaques on the outside, it
 was built in 1884 on the site of Neveh Israel, a synagogue built
 in 1831.  Its major benefactors were the Elias family.  The
 synagogue itself is large and quite grand, in the Sephardic style.
 Its Ark is a large room behind the bimah in which are located 18
 sifrei torah and three scrolls of the neviim, all magnificent
 work, mostly in silver casings of the Perisan style.  On most were
 tags indicating the name of the donor.  The 18 sefrei torah are
 all that remain of a full room -- most have been sent to Israel or
 London.  The congregational records remain in the building.  The
 siddurim are a mixed bag, acquired from here and there.  One was
 in Minhag Polin.</p><p align="justify">

 The synagogue consists of a great hall with seating in alcoves, in
 the following manner:</p><p align="justify">
 On the back wall hangs a framed copy of the congregational
 constitution.  It is written in Rashi script but in a mixture of
 Hebrew and some other language, perhaps Judeo-Persian.  The
 service times were posted as 5:30 P.M.  There is a daily minyan.</p><p align="justify">

 Since I had to lecture in the afternoon, my wife, Harriet, went
 back at 4:30 to meet the people.  As a result of her meeting, Mr.
 Hyam appeared the next morning at breakfast to talk with us and
 Mr. Moses, the Hazzan of the congregation appeared in the evening,
 when Mr. Hyam also returned.
</p><p align="justify">
 Mr. Hyam brought us a gift -- a worm eaten copy of the booklet
 issued by the World Zionist Organization in 1947 to celebrate the
 50th anniversary of the first Zionist Congress -- framed and the
 story of his life.  He was born in Darjeeling where his father had
 settled in the mid-nineteenth century.  His father was born in
 Yemen in 1837 and came to Bombay via Aden to escape conditions
 there.  Opportunity beckoned and brought him to Darjeeling where
 he earned a living selling wild animals (snow leopards, Tibetan
 tiger, rare deer, etc.) from Tibet to zoos and circuses in the
 Western world.  He also led the Jewish community in Darjeeling and
 was known as Mori Natan.  He was an all-purpose functionary
 (voluntary, it seems) - shochet, mohel, hazzan, etc.  Services
 were held in hs house and, at its peak, some 100 people would
 gather for Yom Kippur.  Hyam's father died in 1934 at age 97.  The
 Jewish community faded away and Hyam later moved to Calcutta but
 he still has two brothers in Darjeeling.  He has two sons in
 Israel, working in the Timna mines and two marries daughters in
 Calcutta.  If the latter, who are contemplating aliyah, move to
 Israel, he will go with them.  He has a minimal Jewish education
 -- whatever he learned from his father (who, to him, was a
 scholar) but he blows shofar on the High Holy Days with a Yemenite
 shofar that was his father's.  One of the ways he eakes out a
 living is by selling Jewish "antiquities".  We bought a "Menorah"
 of kabbalistic symbols, which apparently hung in a synagogue and
 which he claimed was bought by his father from Yemen.  Many
 similar "menorot" were hanging on the walls of the synagogue we
 visited.</p><p align="justify">
 Mr. Moses is the Hazzan of the Magen David Synagogue and has been
 for 11 years.  He is originally from Rangoon, from a Bagdadi
 family.  He came to Calcutta in 1942, to escape from the Japanese,
 just before his bar mitzvah, and has been there ever since.  The
 rest of his family is scattered.  One brother is in Los Angeles,
 another is a Hazzan in London.  His wife is a nurse but has been
 an invalid, unable to work, for the past three years.  He is not
 well-educated Jewishly but at least has the basics.  When he needs
 help he writes to Rabbi Ezekiel Musliah, rabbi of the Sephardic
 congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, who is originally from
 Calcutta.  Elias Musliah, the rabbi's uncle, is the Secretary (or
 chief officer) of Magen David today.</p><p align="justify">

 The community has approximately 160 Jews, all told.  (One estimate
 was as low as 130 and Hyam estimated 250.)  At one time it had
 6000.  Calcutta itself was founded and developed by the British
 and the Jews came -- principally from the Arabian Sea littoral --
 to participate in the commerce of the British Empire.  Those who
 are left are mostly minor clerks or unemployed.  There are five
 synagogues.  Magen David is the largest.  Attached to it is Neveh
 Israel (the original congregation on the site).  There are two
 others (including Beth El) nearby and a fifth in Chinatown.  Three
 maintain daily minyanim, all participants of which are paid!
 Magen David pays best -- over 200 rupees a month (or about IL200),
 a substantial sum in India's economy.  A few extra people come on
 shabbat but even on Yom Kippur only about three minyanim appear at
 Magen David.  Funds for maintaining the synagogues and minyanim
 come from rentals of the stores located on synagogue-owned
 properties.  It was unclear whether these brought in a substantial
 sum or not.  Moses said no but Hyam indicated that they did.  It
 was also unclear whether or not there were trusts in addition to
 this income.  Hyam said yes and Moses said no but both were vague
 and may not have understood my question.  In any case, the
 synagogues continue to survive by paying people to participate,
 without paying them great sums.  They will not merge, either --
 the old story in Jewish communal life.</p><p align="justify">

 There is no overarching organization in Calculatta.  Each
 synagogue is independent.  There are, in addition, certain common
 organziations.  They include:</p><p align="justify">
    1) The Jewish burial board: Moses is the secretary, a paid
 position.  He earns his livelihood as the Jewish functionary in
 town.<BR>

    2) Jewish boys and girls school.  The boys school has five
 students and the girls school, six.  In both cases, the teachers
 are Bengalis.  No Jewish subjects are taught.  The boys know no
 Hebrew but they learn some prayers by rote.<BR>

    3) The Jewish hospital: It has been taken over by the
 government but with the proviso that four beds are reserved for
 the Jews (two male, two female).  The hospital is run down due to
 what the Jews suggest is mismanagement.  They have a low opinion
 of the Indians, especially after the British.</p><p align="justify">

 Fifteen years ago there was a Zionist organization led by a Polish
 Jewish dentist who lectured at the university.  When he went to
 Geneva, the organization collapsed.</p><p align="justify">

 Apparently the community tries to take care of its poor and none
 are as poor as one can be in Calcutta.  However, they do not seem
 prosperous in the least.  Their major outside Jewish contact is
 the Jewish Agency shaliah in Bombay who visits them every so
 often.  He and the Israeli consul there handle aliyah matters.</p><p align="justify">

 According to Bombay sources, in the 1950's there was a Zionist
 Organization in Calcutta, led by a Polish-Jewish Dentist who
 lectured at the University of West Bengal.  When he moved to
 Geneva, the organization collapsed.</p><p align="justify">

 22-24 January - Madras:</p><p align="justify">

 All that is left of Jewish life in Madras is the remembered site
 of an old Jewish cemetery (now a schoolyard) in the original site
 and one Bene Israel girl from Bombay married to a local Hindu.
 Twice there have been Jewish communities in that southern Indian
 city: the first time in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
 when Portuguese Marranos and their descendants and later
 Ashkenazim from London, joined the British East India Company in
 their commercial institution.</p><p align="justify">

 That community disappeared by the end of the eighteenth century.
 After World War I, some Jewish refugees from Europe found their
 way to Madras.  They even maintained a Jewish life of sorts,
 meeting for services at the home of an Austrian Jew named Wolf who
 functioned as the convenor of the "community".  When he died
 (apparently in the 1950's), the community disappeared as an
 entity.  There were twenty Jews living in Madras in 1968 but they
 have since migrated elsewhere.  These "Hebrew merchants" were
 particularly active in the diamond trade and were officially
 represented in the Madras city government by Jewish aldermen.</p><p align="justify">


 25-28 January - Bombay:</p><p align="justify">

 The Bombay Jewish community seems to have changed very little
 since my visit five years ago.  Emigration to Israel has virtually
 stopped, though a trickle continues.  There is no mass movement,
 however, and no one is talking about the community closing its
 doors or disappearing as was the case in 1970.
</p><p align="justify">
 Hersch Cynowitz remains the head of the community.  Mr. Cynowitz
 is a most unique man in Bombay.  He comes from near Bialystock,
 was trained as a lawyer and worked in the Vilna court system.  He
 came to India in 1943 as a refugee and has been there ever since.
 Since he was known to the Jewish Agency, he has been an active and
 dominant figure in the community for many years.  He is a true
 example of a between-the-wars Polish-Jewish politician, a
 "professional" even if he does not get paid for waht he does.  He
 really enjoys the politics of Jewish communal life and its public
 affairs aspects.  He is really part of the same "establishment"
 that has dominated Israel: and world Jewish politics until very
 recently: same background, same values, came outlook, same
 interests.  For this community, he is a "find".  Apparently, a
 majority of the community think so too since they reelect him
 despite ocassional opposition and the existence of a clique that
 opposes him directly in every way.
</p><p align="justify">
 In a way, Cynowitz is a Jewish political "boss".  He does favors
 for people (as he puts it, "I am never too busy and when I say I
 will do something, I deliver").  He knows everyone and makes it a
 point to know everyone.  He circulates among people, building up
 contacts wuth the authorities, on one hand, and his
 "constitutents", on the other.  He maintains his contacts
 throughout the Jewish world.  He even does "case work" for his
 constituents in India and Israel, insofar as the opportunities
 present themselves.
</p><p align="justify">
 In 1970, I watched Cynowitz in action when we visited the local
 Jewish school.  He is a perfect politican, saying hello to people,
 asking their names, shaking hands, patting them on the back; all
 the ingredients that go into a political man who is always
 campaigning.  He would ask them if they were related to so-and-so,
 where they were from, all the standard gambits.  In fact, however,
 Cynowitz did not run any programs of an institutional kind.  He
 collected money through the U.I.A., he maintained an
 organizational front through the Bombay Zionist Association, and
 he did case work and protected Jewish rights through the Central
 Board, but he was not cconnected with or responsible for the
 running fo schools, hospitals, welfare programs, or anything like
 that.  That was just not his job and, if it was anybody's it
 belonged to the independent institutional committees.</p><p align="justify">

 Cynowitz ran political errands of a higher nature.  According to
 his own account, he got a street named for his former parton, Mr.
 Moses who was also mayor of Bombay.  (Mayor of Bombay, like being
 mayor of London or Dublin, it is an honorary position rotated
 every year)  This took a lot of effort.  On another level, after
 the El Aksa Mosque fire he immediately went to the authorities
 when he saw the Muslims beginning to demonstrate and convinced
 them that they should be on an alert because the Muslims and the
 Jews live very close together and he did not want any pogroms to
 occur.  He had to disturb the authorities after hours but he was
 successful in doing so and they did go into alert.  Apparently
 this is the kind of thing for which he maintains contacts.  Also,
 when two older Jewish women returned from Israel to India, they
 did not have proper papers and were detained on a Sunday at the
 airport.  He rousted out the appropriate officials all the way up
 to the higher civil service level and got the women cleared
 through by sheer persistence.  He kept telling them "How can you
 eat when there are women held in a pen at the airport?' and it
 apparently worked.  Of course, as president of the Central Board
 he was at all functions and greeted all sorts of people.  But his
 political work was apparently the biggest aspect of his activity.
</p><p align="justify">

 Mr. Cynowitz's position in India comes from the fact that he
 filled a vacuum in the 1940's.  Until then, the community was led
 by the Iraqi "first families" -- the Sassoons, Moses, Kadouries,
 etc.  Most of them, however, were cool or cold toward Indian
 independence and, as the independence movement began to succeed,
 they moved out of India and out of communal leadership.  Moses,
 who was an Indian, brought Cynowitz into the picture.  Unlike the
 overwhelming majority of the Europeans in India at the time,
 Cynowitz became an Indian.  He took an Indian passport and to
 turned down a British one to become one of the first Europeans to
 become and Indian citizen.  This made him especially meritorious
 in the eyes of the new government na dhe has never lost the
 strength it gave him.  At the same time, he also cultivated the
 Bene Israel and became their leader.  He could organize and e
 he could deliver.  He has never lost their support either.  To
 these two pillars, he added a third; his connections with that
 part of the world Jewish community that "counted", namely the
 World Zionist Organization, the World Jewish Congress, and the
 Israeli Government.
</p><p align="justify">

 Mr. Cynowitz became the contact between Indian Jewry and the rest
 of world Jewry.  More than that, he created the contacts and then
 channeled them through himself.  He organized the first Indian
 delegation to a World Zionist Congress in 1946, and several as the
 delegate.  He represented Jewish Agency then and was responsible
 for allocating immigration certificates to Palestine. ( The Bombay
 Zionist Organization was founded in 1920 but was only active in
 fits and starts.  It had 40 members in the 1940's when Cynowitz
 arrived.  He built it up to 300 members.  He is an old Weitzman
 supporter aligned with Moshe Kol in the Progressive (now
 Independent Liberal) Party.  Thus he is "out" politically in the
 Zionist movement.
</p><p align="justify">

 I had a very hard time finding Mr. Cynowitz.  He had been bery
 sick and had been in Israel for an extended period for treatment.
 Nevertheless when his health improved, he chose to go back to
 India, but he had given up his apartment and was moving around.
 People seemed to be very secretive about where he was but we left
 word at a number of places which he was known to frequent,
 including the hotel which was his last known address.  He received
 our messages and he called us, after which I met with him and we
 resumed our discussions where they were left off several years
 ago.  He has now been admitted to the Bar in India on the basis of
 his European training.  He claims to be the only person to have
 achieved that distinction and is working as a practicing lawyer.
</p><p align="justify">

 Once again, Cynowitz talked of giving up the presidency of the
 community.  His Indian constituents are begging him not to and it
 seems as if he will give in.  He says there is no other leadership
 that could possibly handle the job he goes.  For example, during
 the 1960's and early 1970's, the Zionist Association published the
 community's only periodical.  It's official editor was only a
 figurehead.  Cynowitz  employed a young man to really handle the
 work and he does some of the checking himself.  Once he could no
 longer keep the Review going, it was closed down.  Cynowitz still
 likes the Indians.  He says they are a nice gentle people,
 very passive, by which he means unable to take initiatives.
</p><p align="justify">
 Our non-Jewish driver, knowing of our Jewish interest, took us to
 one of the neighborhood synagogues at the time of Minha.  It was
 shabby, the people in it were shabby, but there was a minyan and
 there is twice a day, every day, probably paid an in Calcutta from
 the looks of the people involved.  That, too, is no different from
 the way it was in 1970.  The siddurim were printed in Morocco by
 the Joint Distribution Committee, originally for use there, it
 seems.</p><p align="justify">
 Organized Jewish life in Bombay continues despite the aliyah of
 most of Indian Jewry.  Finally, no organizations have gone out of
 existence.  All the synagogues continue to function.  There are
 more and in some respects, better organizations than before.
 Still, the Jewish organizations of Bombay are generally limited in
 scope and intensity.  The synagogues remain the most important
 continuing institutions.  They include: Gate of Mercy Synagogue,
 the oldest synagogue founded in the 1790's.  It is a corporation
 with its own governing committee.  It owns properties that provide
 it with an income, so that membership fees are nominal.  Hebrew
 classes are held on its premises, taught by local teachers trained
 in Israel and working under the supervision of the Jewish Agency
 shaliach.  It has a Gemiluth Hassidim society and is legally the
 trustee of the local Jeish orphanage.  The synagogue calls itself
 Conservative but is really no different from an Orthodox
 congregation in its ritual.  The conservative "leader" is Emanuel
 Moses, and officer of the Indian Customs Service.  His father was
 mayor of Bombay and president of the Central Jewish Board.  His
 father brought Cynowitz into the Board.
</p><p align="justify">

 The Jewish Religious Union was founded by Claude Montefiore as a
 reform synagogue 50 years ago.  Their president, M.A. Moses, is
 the chairman of the Central Jewish Board.  The members include
 notables of the community, most of whom are in the professions.
 There are two synagogues supported by Sassoon family trust funds.
 They have no membership or governing committees.  Jews just come
 to pray.  As such, those synagogue cannot be members of the
 Central Jewish Board.</p><p align="justify">


 In addition to the synagogues, there are a number of other
 organizations.  Most tend to be weaker but there is always one
 which functions as a catalyst of communal life.  In 1976, it was
 the Jewish Youth Association of Bombay which includes young adults
 18-30 years of age.  They do such fundraising work as is done in
 the community, whether Maot Hittim for established residents,
 United Israel Appeal for Israel, or aid for new migrants onto
 Bombay from the surrounding villages.  They organized themselves
 after the Six Day War, as a result of its impact.
</p><p align="justify">

 India has no rabbis and no Bet Din.  Nor have they ever had,
 except for Rabbi Ezekiel Muslead, a Calcutta a native educated at
 the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York who served in his
 native city for a few years in the 1950's and an occasional
 "stray" who wandered in for awhile.  The community has tried to
 get a rabbis to come out from time to time but they cannot pay
 much so none are willing to come and perform a service like that.
</p><p align="justify">

 All three world synagogue movements are represented in India, as a
 result of the efforts of visitors from the U.S.A. who have
 capitalized on Indian Jewish poverty and dependency to generate
 nominal affiliations with "worldwide" movements.  The Conservative
 Movement in India was characterized by one local authority as "all
 bluff".  The affiliated congregations are all orthodox in
 practice.  The United Synagogue of India originally consisted of
 some village synagogues to whom the Conservative Movement in the
 U.S. sent $500-$1,000 annually in a lump sum.  Under village
 conditions this was enough money to lead to conflict over its
 distribution, thus increasing disunity rather than unity. Cynowitz
 put it in the following terms: " I told them, if you wanted to
 help us why didn't you send us a Rabbi?  To Haifa you have to send
 a Rabbi, there aren't enough Rabbis in Haifa?  Why can't you send
 one to Bombay if you're serious?"  Now it has Bombay afflicted as
 well.  There is one Reform congregation which is really reform,
 even "orthodox" in its maintenance of Reform practices.  The Union
 of Orthodox Jewish Congregations was organized in response to the
 United Synagogue but it does not mean much either.</p><p align="justify">

 They also provide Hebrew lessons for interested members.  Its
 members are the activists in the community, to the extent that
 there are any.  They are strong supporters of Jewish education and
 serve on the boards of the local Jewish schools.</p><p align="justify">


 Prior to the emergence of this group, which was undertaken by
 Hersch, Cynowitz, he also ran the United Israel Appeal.  In the
 1970's, it raised 20 to 50 thousand rupees annually with great
 difficulty.  The money can be raised openly but there are problems
 about transferring it to Israel in convertable currency since
 rupees cannot be converted abroad.  They have worked out a way to
 do so involving the Israel Consulate.  Apparently through some
 kind of nominal commercial transaction which allowed them to send
 the money out of the country in dollars.</p><p align="justify">


 The Bombay Zionist Association in 1967 was larger than ever before
 but most of its members were nominally affiliated only.  There
 have been two Zionist youth movements in Bombay.  Bnei Akiva is
 still active as a youth movement locally.  Habonim, on the other
 hand, existed at least until 1965, but is no more.</p><p align="justify">


 As long as Hersch Cynowitz was alive, Indian Jewry had strong
 representation in the World Zionist Organization because of his
 role and connections.  Since his death, no one has taken his
 place.  Mr. Cynowitz was put on the Zionist General Council
 Actions Committee primarily because he is the one man the WZO
 leadership can depend upon from South Asia or the Far East.  He
 was the only delegate from India, not because India is too small,
 but because he was not affiliated with Mapai.  He was a follower
 of Moshe Kol, that is to say a Progressive or Independent Liberal,
 and as such, at a disadvantage.  He did not allow the kind of
 representation given to the Jews of Iran which, while simply a
 paper organization registered in Jeruslaem with four or five
 people in Iran, received four or five votes because the parties in
 Jerusalem decided to divide these votes equally among themselves.</p><p align="justify">
