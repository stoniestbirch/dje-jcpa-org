<I>Beyond Israel's self-definition as a Jewish state, the question
remains as to what extent Israel is a continuation of Jewish
political history within the context of the Jewish political
tradition.  This article addresses that question, first by
looking at the realities of Israel as a Jewish state and at the
same time one compounded of Jews of varying ideologies and
persuasions, plus non-Jews; the tensions between the desire on
the part of many Israeli Jews for Israel to be a state like any
other and the desire on the part of others for it to manifest its
Jewishness in concrete ways that will make it unique.  The
article explores the ways in which the traditional domains of
authority into which power is divided in the Jewish political
tradition are manifested in the structure of Israel's political
system, both structurally and politically; relations between the
Jewish religion, state and society; the Jewish dimension of
Israel's political culture and policy-making and how both are
manifested through Israel's emerging constitution and the
character of its democracy.
</I></p><p align="justify"><BR>



Built into the founding of every polity are certain unresolved
tensions that are balanced one against each other as part of that
founding to make the existence of the polity possible, but which
must be resolved anew in every generation.  Among the central
tensions built into the founding of the State of Israel are those
that revolve around Israel as a Jewish state.
</p><p align="justify">

Formally, Israel is built on the modern European model of
centralized, reified statehood.  In contrast, the weight of the
Jewish political tradition, while emphasizing the importance of
political independence for Jewish survival and fulfillment, is
directed against that conception of statehood.  Though rarely
recognized for what it is, the Jewish political tradition still
animates the attitudes of Jews towards political institutions,
including states, more than they know.  One tension in the minds
of Israelis and others is between Israel as a modern European
state and Israel as a continuation of traditional Jewish
political aspirations and attitudes.  This is an appropriate
starting point for a consideration of Israel as a Jewish state.
</p><p align="justify">

Three other factors force the rejection of European conceptions
of statehood in favor of a conception more appropriate to the
Israeli situation: (1) Israel is the state of the Jewish people.
(2) Israel is only one of the states in Eretz Israel.  (3) Israel
as a state is a compound polity. These factors lead us to search
for an understanding of Israeli statehood appropriate to its
conditions.
</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>          Statehood and the Jewish Political Tradition
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Before examination of the three factors, a word is in order about
the idea of statehood in the Jewish political tradition. The idea
of the Jewish people living independently in their own land
stands at the heart of that tradition.  No matter how reckoned in
the traditional sources, the fulfillment of the mitzvot in their
completeness depends on the existence of a Jewish polity in Eretz
Israel.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

Though vitally important to enable the Jewish people to fulfill
the tasks for which they were commissioned by God, for the
tradition the polity is a means to that end but not an end in
itself. Classic Hebrew reflects this.  There is no generic term
for state in the Bible or the Talmud.  The Hebrew term <I>medinah</I>,
now used for state, appears in both; in the Bible it refers to an
autonomous political jurisdiction (the equivalent of a Land in
German or one of the fifty states of the United States), that is,
a territory under a common <I>din</I> (law), whose identity is marked by
having its own political institutions but not politically
sovereign in the modern sense.  In the Talmud, the term is used
even more vaguely from a political perspective, as in <I>medinat
hayam</I>, roughly translated as some distant jurisdiction.  Only in
modern times did m<I>edinah</I> come to be used to describe a "sovereign
state."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">
Hebrew, and therefore the Jewish political tradition, has
different terms for different political systems, each of which
focuses on a particular relationship between governors and
governed.  Thus the rich political terminology of biblical Hebrew
described relationships rather than "states," using terms such as
<I>edah</I> (assembly), <I>malkhut</I> (kingship), <I>mamlakhah</I> (dominion--the
term closest to state in the modern sense), and <I>kahal</I>
(congregation--in its civil sense--the closest Hebrew generic
term for polity).<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


In the biblical view, peoples, nations, and languages have the
kind of permanence as entities that states have in modern
European political thought.  What is not fixed for peoples is the
form of regime or political structure under which they operate.
Peoples, nations, and languages are concrete, hence they are
permanent; states are abstractions, hence they are identified
only as they are manifested as regimes.
</p><p align="justify">

The chief reason for the classic Jewish rejection of state
sovereignty in its European form rests with the strong belief
that ultimate sovereignty reposes in God alone and that humans
exercise delegated powers under the terms of God's covenants
which give the people an effective share in the exercise of
sovereign powers.  The <I>edah</I> is the primary delegatee of the power
to govern the Jewish people, acting either as a whole or in
conjunction with officers and institutions which it establishes
under God's providence.  Together, the <I>edah</I>, its officers, and
God establish regimes through subsidiary covenants under the
terms of the original covenant between God and Israel as embodied
in the Torah.  Under such a system there can be no reified
state.
</p><p align="justify">

A state is a receptacle through which the true exercisers of
sovereignty can establish a political order but has no life apart
from them--something closer to a medinah in the biblical sense.
That is why the most accurate term for describing the classic
Jewish polity is <I>edah</I>, the term used to describe the polity
established by Moses and Jewish communities in every subsequent
age until the present.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>  In contemporary Israel, the term has
been distorted to acquire a new, misleading meaning of cultural
subgroup within the Jewish people.  In this context, the meaning
of the expression <I>am v'edah</I> becomes more sharply focuses; the
terms together combine the dual bonds linking the Jewish people,
kinship (<I>am</I>), and consent (<I>edah</I>).</p><p align="justify">

This political framework and orientation, which has its roots in
the Bible, continued to be dominant in the Jewish political
tradition, even during the years of exile.  Even when outside
authorities attempted to impose patterns of rule on the Jewish
people or some segments of it, as in Babylonia, the Jews found
ways at least to redefine those patterns in the set of
relationships that is in accord with the political tradition.  In
the Middle Ages, when local communities had more autonomy, this
framework and orientation was crystal clear in hundreds if not
thousands of <I>haskamot</I> and <I>takanot</I>.  The great debate of medieval
Jewry as to whether communities can rule by majority decisions or
require unanimity for their decisions to take effect shows this
conception of the polity as <I>edah</I>.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT>
</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>           The Foundations of the World Jewish Polity
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

From the perspective of both historical Judaism and Zionism, Jews
are members of a polity built around a covenantal community
linked by a shared destiny, a promised land, and a common pattern
of communications whose essential community of interest and
purpose and whose ability to consent together in matters of
common interest have been repeatedly demonstrated.  In
traditional terms, Judaism is essentially a theopolitical
phenomenon, a means of seeking salvation by constructing God's
polity, the proverbial "city upon a hill" through which the
covenantal community takes on meaning and fulfills its purpose in
the divine scheme of things. Jewish peoplehood has been the
motivating force for communal life and creativity throughout the
long history of the Jewish people. The power and pervasiveness of
this force has certainly been demonstrated in our own time.
</p><p align="justify">

The Jewish polity is worldwide in scope but partially
territorial.  It is more than a state, although a state is an
essential part of it.  It is authoritative but only for those who
accept citizenship within it. Many of its members share more than
one political loyalty.  It exists by virtue of a mystique, an
orientation toward a future that looks to the redemption of
mankind. Preeminently, the Jewish polity survives because of the
will of its citizens and their active application of that will to
carve out an area of autonomous existence in the midst of
polities that would absorb or eliminate them.  As it turns out,
this is as true of Israel in its own way as it has been of the
diaspora Jewish communities, just as it was true of all the
earlier Jewish commonwealths.
</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>             Covenant and the Origins of the Polity
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

Since its beginnings, political science has identified three
basic ways in which polities come into existence: conquest,
organic development, and covenant.  These questions of origins
are not abstract; the mode of founding of a polity does much to
determine the framework for its later political life.
</p><p align="justify">

Conquest can be understood to include not only its most direct
manifestation, a conqueror gaining control of a land or a people,
but also such subsidiary ways as a revolutionary conquest of an
existing state, a coup d'etat, or even an entrepreneur conquering
a market and institutionalizing his control through corporate
means.  Conquest tends to produce hierarchically organized
regimes ruled in an authoritarian manner: power pyramids with the
conqueror on top, his agents in the middle, and the people
underneath the entire structure.  The original expression of this
kind of polity was the pharaonic state of ancient Egypt.  It was
hardly an accident that those rulers who brought the pharaonic
state to its fullest development had the pyramids built as their
tombs.  Although the pharaonic model has been judged illegitimate
in Western society, modern totalitarian theories, particularly
fascism and nazism, represent an attempt to give it theoretical
legitimacy.</p><p align="justify">


Organic evolution involves the development of political life from
its beginnings in families, tribes, and villages to large
polities in such a way that institutions, constitutional
relationships, and power alignments emerge in response to the
interaction between past precedent and changing circumstances
with the minimum of deliberate constitutional choice.  The result
is a polity with a single center of power, dominated by an
accepted political elite, controlling the periphery, which may or
may not have influence at the center.  Classic Greek political
thought emphasized the organic evolution of the polity and
rejected any other means of polity-building as deficient or
improper.  The organic model is closely related to the concept of
natural law in the political order.  Natural law informs the
world and, when undisturbed, leads to a kind of organic
development, which, in turn, results in this model of the polity.
</p><p align="justify">

The organic model has proved most attractive to political
philosophers precisely because, at its best, it seems to reflect
the natural order of things.  Thus it has received the most
intellectual and academic attention.  However, just as conquest
produces hierarchically organized regimes ruled in an
authoritarian manner, organic evolution produces oligarchic
regimes, which, at their best, have an aristocratic flavor and,
at their worst, are simply the rule of the many by the few.  In
the first, the goal is to control the top of the pyramid; in the
second, the goal is to control the center of power.</p><p align="justify">


Covenantal foundings emphasize the deliberate coming together of
humans as equals to establish bodies politic so that all reaffirm
their fundamental equality and retain their basic liberties.
Polities whose origins are covenantal reflect the exercise of
constitutional choice and broad-based participation in
constitutional design.  Polities founded by covenant are
essentially federal in the original meaning of the term--whether
they are federal in structure or not.  That is, each polity is a
matrix compounded of equal confederates who come together freely
and retain their respective integrities even as they are bound in
a common whole.  Such polities are republican by definition, and
power in them must be diffused among many centers or the cells
within the matrix.
</p><p align="justify">

Recurring expressions of the covenant model are found among the
Jews, whose people started out as rebels against pharaonic Egypt;
the Swiss, whose people started out as rebels against the Holy
Roman Empire; the and Dutch, Scots, and Puritans who rebelled
against the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the Reformation era.  In
the modern epoch, republicans who were rebels against either
hierarchical or organic theories of the state adopted the
covenant model in one version or another.  Frontiersmen--people
who have chosen to settle new areas where there are no
established patterns of governance in which to fit and who,
therefore, have had to compact with one another to create
governing institutions--are to be found among the most active
covenanters.
</p><p align="justify">

What is common to all developed political societies rooted in the
covenant idea is that they have drawn their inspiration
proximately or ultimately from its biblical source.  There is
evidence of other contractual or oath-bound societies, whether in
pagan Scandinavia or among various Native American peoples, and,
of course, constitutionalism of various kinds exists outside the
biblical tradition.  But there is no evidence of any developed
covenantal tradition that is not derived from the Bible.
</p><p align="justify">

The biblical grand design for humankind is federal in three ways.
(1) It is based on a network of covenants beginning with those
between God and man, which weave the web of human, especially
political, relationships in a federal way--through pact,
association, and consent.  (2) The classic biblical commonwealth
was a fully articulated federation of tribes instituted and
reaffirmed by covenant to function under a common constitution
and laws.  Any and all constitutional changes in the Israelite
polity were introduced through covenanting, and even after the
introduction of the monarchy, the federal element was maintained
until most of the tribal structures were destroyed by external
forces.  The biblical vision of the restored commonwealth in the
messianic era envisages the reconstitution of the tribal
federation.  (3) The biblical vision for the "end of days"--the
messianic era--not only sees a restoration of Israel's tribal
federation, but what is, for all intents and purposes, a world
confederation of nations, each preserving its own integrity while
accepting a common divine covenant and constitutional order. This
order will establish appropriate covenantal relationships for the
entire world.  Although it shares many of the same positive ends,
it is the antithesis of the ecumenical world state envisaged by
the Roman and Christian traditions, which see the merging of
everyone into a single entity.  The biblical-covenantal-Jewish
view sees peoples preserving their own integrities within a
shared whole.
</p><p align="justify">

Covenant theory emphasizes human freedom because only free people
can enter into agreements with one another.  It also presupposes
the need for government and the need to organize civil society on
principles that assure the maintenance of those rights and the
exercise of power in a cooperative or partnership-like way.
</p><p align="justify">
Covenantal (or federal) liberty, however, is not simply the right
to do as one pleases within broad boundaries.  Federal liberty
emphasizes liberty to pursue the moral purposes for which the
covenant was made.  This latter kind of liberty requires that
moral distinctions be drawn and that human actions be judged
according to the terms of the covenant.  This does not preclude
changes in social norms, but the principles of judgment remain
constant.  Consequently, covenantal societies, founded as they
are on covenantal choice, emphasize constitutional design and
choice as a continuing process.</p>

<H3><CENTER>                     Covenantal Foundations<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT>
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Jews have traditionally organized their communities into coherent
bodies politic on a constitutional basis.  In Jewish law, every
Jewish community is a partnership of its members and does not
exist apart from them. The ultimate constitutional basis of that
partnership is the covenant that tradition records as having been
made between God and the twelve tribes of Israel at Sinai.  From
that covenant came the Torah, the traditional constitution of the
Jewish people.  According to tradition, God's covenant with
Israel established the Jewish people and founded it as a body
politic, while at the same time creating the religious framework
that gave that polity its raison d'etre, its norms, and its
constitution, as well as the guidelines for developing a
political order based on proper, that is, covenantal,
relationships.</p><p align="justify">


When Jews speak of Torah, they do not refer to the five books of
Moses alone but to the Torah as it has grown, with the Talmud
added to it, with the interpretations and commentaries added to
both, in the light of the historical experience of the Jewish
people.  Until modern times, nobody disputed the traditional
constitution.  Jews may have argued over the interpretation of
the Torah, but they accepted it as constitutionally binding. Out
of that acceptance the Jewish polity was given constitutional
form.</p><p align="justify">


The covenantal approach not only informs and animates the Jewish
polity but represents the greatest Jewish contribution to
political life and thought. Ancient Israel transformed and
perfected the vassal treaties through which the empire builders
of west Asia secured the fealty of smaller peoples and their
domains. Biblical adaptation of the forms of the vassal covenants
involved a transformation of their purpose and content so great
as to mean a difference in kind, not merely degree.  A covenant
was used to found a people, making their moral commitment to one
another strong and enduring.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                 The<I> Edah</I> as a Classic Republic
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

The Jewish polity has followed the covenant model since its
inception, adapting it to variegated circumstances in which Jews
have found themselves over the millennia--as a tribal federation,
a federal monarchy, a state with a diaspora, a congress of
covenantal communities, a network of regional federations or
confederations, or a set of voluntary associations.</p><p align="justify">


The classic Hebrew name for this kind of polity is <I>edah</I>: the
assembly of all the people constituted as a body politic.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT> In
Mosaic times <I>edah</I> became the Hebrew equivalent of "commonwealth"
or "republic," with strong democratic overtones. The idea of the
Jewish people as an <I>edah</I> has persisted ever since and the term
has been used to describe the Jewish body politic in every period
to the present.  In this respect, the term parallels (and
historically precedes) similar phenomena such as the
<I>landesgemeinde</I> in Switzerland, the Icelandic <I>althing</I>, and the
town meeting in the United States.</p><p align="justify">


The characteristics of the original<I> edah</I> can be summarized as
follows:</p>
<OL type="1">
	<LI>  The Torah is the constitution of the<I> edah</I>.
	<LI>  All members of the <I>edah</I>, men, women, and children, participate
 in constitutional decisions of a founding character.
	<LI>  Political equality exists for those capable of taking full
	responsibility for Jewish survival.
	<LI>  Decisions are made by an assembly that determines its own
leaders within the parameters of divine mandate.
	<LI>  The<I> edah</I> is portable and transcends geography.
	<LI>  Nevertheless, for it to function completely, the<I> edah</I> needs
 Eretz Israel.
</OL>
<p align="justify">

These basic characteristics have been preserved with such
modifications as were necessary over the centuries.  Thus, in
biblical times, taking full responsibility for Jewish survival
meant being able to bear arms.  Subsequently, the arms-bearing
measure of political equality gave way to one of Torah study.
Today the diaspora measure is contributing to the support of
Israel, while arms-bearing is again the measure in Israel.  The
principles of assembly, leadership, and decision-making have
remained the same although modes of assembling, leadership
recruitment, and leaders' roles and responsibilities have changed
from time to time.  The portability of the desert-born <I>edah</I> is as
notable a characteristic as is its attachment to Zion.  The Torah
has persisted as the<I> edah</I>'s constitution albeit with changing
interpretations.</p><p align="justify">


Jewish republicanism is rooted in a democratic foundation based
on the equality of all Jews as citizens of the Jewish people.
All Jews must participate in the establishment and maintenance of
their polity, as demonstrated in the Bible and in many other
sources.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT> Nor is that foundation merely theoretical; even where
power may not be exercised on a strictly democratic basis, it is
generally exercised in light of democratic norms.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


There are problems associated with the use of these terms, but
they do help us understand that the Jewish polity is republican,
because it is a <I>res publica</I>, a public thing or a commonwealth--a
body politic that belongs to its members.  The Jewish people is a
<I>res publica</I> with a commitment to a teaching and law, which its
members are not free simply to alter as they wish but must be
maintained to be faithful to principles. The history of
governance in the Jewish community has been one of swinging
between the two poles of aristocratic republicanism and
oligarchy.  Though this is a perennial problem, the basic
republicanism of the Jewish polity has worked equally well to
prevent absolutism or autocracy.
</p><p align="justify">

The Jewish people rarely has had anything like dictatorship and
then only locally and de facto under unique circumstances.  Jews
are a notably intractable people, even under conditions of
statehood where coercion theoretically has been possible; hence,
dictatorship has not been an acceptable regime for Jews.  Nor
have Jews in the past had anything like the open society of the
kind envisaged by many contemporary Americans, in which every
individual is free to choose his or her own "life-style."  One of
the reasons for this is that being Jewish and maintaining the
Jewish polity has not been simply a matter of survival.  It has
also been a matter of living up to specific norms based on divine
teaching and law, which establish the expectation that private
and public life is to be shaped according to that teaching and
law.</p><BR>



<H3><CENTER>        The Three Arenas of Jewish Political Organization
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

From earliest times, the Jewish polity has been organized in
three arenas.  Besides the<I> edah</I>, or national, arena, there are
countrywide or regional, and local arenas of organization.  The
immediately local arena comprises local Jewish communities around
the world of varying sizes, under varying forms of communal
organization. Here the institutions that serve the Jewish
community are organized and function.
</p><p align="justify">

Beyond the local arena, there is a larger, countrywide arena in
which the Jews in particular regions, countries, or states
organize for common purposes.  The organizational expressions of
that arena have included such phenomena as the Resh Galuta
(Exilarch) and Yeshivot of Babylonia, the Vaad Arba Aratzot
(Council of the Four Lands) of late medieval Poland, the State of
Israel, the Board of Deputies of British Jewry, and the congeries
of "national" (meaning countrywide) organizations of American
Jewry framed by the Council of Jewish Federations.  Fundraising
for Israel, for example, depends on work on local communities but
is generally organized in this second arena on a
country-by-country basis.
</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                       The Three Ketarim<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT>
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
Classically, authority and power in the Jewish polity has been
divided and shared among three domains known in Hebrew as the
three <I>ketarim</I> (crowns): the <I>keter torah</I>, the domain of the Torah;
the <I>keter kehunah</I>, the domain of the priesthood; and the <I>keter
malkhut</I>, literally, the crown of kingship but more correctly
understood as the domain of governance.  Each of these <I>ketarim</I>
has functions it must perform if Jewish life is to be complete;
hence, all are necessary for the survival and development of the
edah.  There has never been a time when the <I>edah</I> has not in some
way functioned through the three <I>ketarim</I>.  This is not separation
of powers in the modern sense.  The <I>ketaric</I> division is for
comprehensive polities which embrace more than the organs of
government as moderns understand them.  Hence it comes prior to
the executive-legislative-judicial division.  Each <I>keter</I>
combines a range of functions, institutions, and roles within its
domain.</p><p align="justify">

The <I>keter torah </I>embraces those who are responsible for the
maintenance and application of the Torah, its laws, principles,
and spirit in the life of the Jewish people and governance of the
<I>edah</I>.  Its roots go back to Moses, the first <I>navi</I> (prophet) and,
as such, the first to bear that <I>keter.</I>  After the age of
prophecy, it passed to the <I>soferim </I>(scribes) and then to the
Sanhedrin with its <I>hakhamim</I> (sages) and rabbis.  In the
traditional Jewish polity, its bearers functioned primarily as
teachers and judges.
</p><p align="justify">

The <I>keter kehunah</I> embraces those who are responsible for the
ritual and sacerdotal expressions of Jewish being, designed to
bring Jews closer to Heaven individually and collectively (and
hence to each other as Jews).  From a public perspective, the
functions of this crown play a major role in determining the fact
and character of citizenship in the <I>edah</I>.  Originally granted in
the Torah to Aaron and his heirs, it is principally identified
with the <I>cohanim</I>, but after the destruction of the Second Temple,
its functions passed to other religious functionaries,
principally <I>hazzanim</I> and, more recently, congregational rabbis,
and generally were confined to the most local arena of Jewish
organization.</p><p align="justify">


The <I>keter malkhut</I> embraces those who are responsible for
conducting the civil business of the<I> edah</I>: to establish and
manage its organized framework, its political and social
institutions, to raise and expend the money needed for the
functioning of the <I>edah</I>, and to handle its political and civic
affairs.  Although, like the others, it is bound by the
Torah-as-constitution, this <I>keter</I> has existed as a separate
source of authority since the beginning of the <I>edah</I>, with its own
institutions, responsibilities, and tasks.  It is the oldest of
the <I>ketarim</I>, emerging out of the patriarchal leadership of the
original Israelite families.  Later, it passed to the <I>nesi'im</I>
(magistrates), <I>shofetim</I> (judges), and <I>zekenim (</I>elders), and then
to the <I>melekh</I> (king).  After the end of Jewish political
independence in Eretz Israel, it was carried on by the Nasi
(patriarch) in Eretz Israel and the Resh Galuta (exilarch) in
Babylonia, the <I>negidim</I> of Spain, and the <I>parnassim</I> of the
<I>kehillot</I>.  
</p><p align="justify">

Thus, one of the ways in which Jews have attempted to prevent the
corruption of their governing bodies is through the division of
powers in the polity. This traditional pattern underwent many
changes in the modern epoch but continued to be the basic model
for the <I>edah</I> and its <I>kehillot</I>, if only out of necessity, because
the classic division persisted in new forms.  In the nineteenth
century, the institutions of the <I>keter kehunah</I> became stronger at
the expense of the others as Jewish life was redefined under
modernity to be primarily "religious," even as Jews ceased to
rely on the Torah as binding law.  The synagogues became
elaborate institutions and their rabbis the principal
instrumentalities of the <I>keter kehunah</I>.  Today, however, the
Jewish polity is in the midst of a resurgence of the <I>keter
malkhut</I>.  This is principally because of the reestablishment of a
Jewish state in Eretz Israel, but it also reflects changes in the
orientation of Jews in the diaspora.
</p><p align="justify">

The increasing narrowness of approach of the traditional bearers
of the <I>keter torah</I>, coupled with the growing secularization of
Jews which made that sphere and the sphere of <I>keter kehunah</I> less
attractive to them, all contributed to this power shift.  In the
political world, that domain with the key to political power
obviously had an advantage.  In addition, as the other two
domains were fragmented among different movements, each claiming
to be authoritative, the <I>keter malkhut </I>became the only domain in
which all groups would meet together, at least for limited
political purposes, further strengthening the latter's position
in the <I>edah</I>.</p><p align="justify">


These shifts in power are only several of many in the history of
the <I>edah</I>, part of the continuing and dynamic tension among the
<I>ketarim</I>.

<H3><CENTER>        Israel as a Politically Independent Jewish State
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Until the rise of Zionism, the concept of statehood found little
place among those Jews concerned with political matters.  Even in
Zionist theory, there was a great hesitancy to advocate
politically sovereign statehood in the modern sense.  Some
Zionist theorists, such as Ahad Ha'am in the secular camp, and
various religious Zionists sought to avoid statehood, seeing it
as dangerous or improper for Jews.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT> Others, such as Martin
Buber, who could see the need for political independence,
developed a concept of statehood far more in keeping with the
Jewish political tradition.  Buber, indeed, drew heavily on that
tradition to express his own radical conception of what a Jewish
polity should properly be.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


Whatever Zionist theorists may have desired, events created a
consensus that political independence was not only desirable but
necessary if the Zionist enterprise were to succeed and the
Jewish people survive.  Today, with insignificant exceptions,
Israelis and other Jews do not regret that turn in the pursuit of
the Zionist goal.  The only question is, What kind of statehood?
Under what view or conception of the state?</p><p align="justify">


In the early years of Israel's independence, a special effort was
made to strengthen the institutions of the state.  Ben-Gurion's
well-known <I>mamlakhtiut</I> (statism) policy was part of that effort.
While Ben-Gurion understood the limits of <I>mamlakhtiut</I>, the policy
as it gained currency led to a tendency to idolize the state and
its most attractive instrument, the Israel Defense Forces.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT>
Subsequent events have turned Israelis away from that emphasis
and have led them to reconsider the question of what statehood
means in a Jewish state.</p><p align="justify">

The State of Israel also is sui generis in the Jewish world
because it is a Jewish society functioning in a self-consciously
Jewish manner in an epoch that witnessed the disappearance of the
last of such societies in the diaspora.  Thus, although most of
its government institutions are adapted from liberal European
models, they are described in Israel in a political terminology
which invokes the slogans and symbols of earlier epochs of Jewish
rule in Eretz Israel.</p><p align="justify">


Moreover, the institutions of the Israel government, viewed
comprehensively, can be seen to follow the classic threefold
division of Jewish political institutions.
</p><p align="justify">

The government of Israel comprises the <I>keter malkhut</I>.  Most
analyses of Israel's political system stop with them but that is
inaccurate.  While the other <I>ketarim</I> are semi-independent, the
government does play a role in authorizing, regulating, and
funding them.  An examination of the institutions of the polity
shows how this is so.  As a matter of historical continuity,
their names either continue or are derived from biblical
political terminology.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></p><BR>

<p align="justify">

Israel's supreme legislative body is the Knesset (assembly), a
term first used to describe the Anshei Knesset Ha-Gedolah, the
institution established in Jerusalem for the same purpose when
the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile twenty-five hundred
years ago.  The term "knesset" itself is a synonym of<I> edah</I>
developed out of the latter word's Aramaic equivalent.  The
Knesset is elected by universal adult suffrage on a party
(<I>miflagah</I>, from the biblical <I>peleg</I>) list basis through
proportional representation.  Like the Anshei Knesset Ha-Gedolah,
the Knesset has 120 members, equivalent to a <I>minyan</I> (quorum for
constitutional and religious purposes) from each of the
traditional twelve tribes, to symbolize that it represents the
entire people.
</p><p align="justify">

The <I>memshalah</I> (government) -- a term signifying rule over equals,
first used in the first chapter of Genesis for that purpose -- is
organized as a cabinet with collective responsibility.  It must
have the confidence of the Knesset.  The <I>rosh memshalah</I> is head
of the government; rosh is used in a similar political context in
the Bible. The members of the government are called <I>sarim</I>
(ministers; singular: <I>sar</I>), the biblical term for the same kind
of office. Most are also the political heads of <I>misradim
</I>(departments; singular: <I>misrad</I>), a biblical term, used then in
reference to the Temple organization.  They include: <I>otzar</I>
(treasury, a biblical term for the same office), <I>hutz</I> (foreign
affairs), <I>bitahon</I> (defense), <I>p'nim</I> (interior), <I>hinuch</I>
(education), and <I>datot </I>(religions).</p><p align="justify">

While the leading figures in Israel's founding were secularist,
at times even militantly secularist, they had to take into
consideration the realities of Jewish existence and establish
some official framework for the <I>keter torah</I>.  This decision was
taken in the 1920s during the pre-state period when the British
Mandatory government, at the request of the leaders of the
Yishuv, provided for the establishment of the dual Chief
Rabbinate -- Sephardic and Ashkenazic -- with a supporting
Council of the Chief Rabbinate and a system of local chief
rabbis, also dual, attached to it.  Within this framework the
rabbinical courts (<I>batei din rabbaniim</I>), responsible for applying
<I>halakhah</I> in matters of personal status, were established and
continue to function.</p><p align="justify">


These formal institutions of the <I>keter torah</I> became more or less
bureaucratized with only occasional Chief Rabbis performing any
kind of spiritual as well as <I>halakhic</I> function.  The first Chief
Rabbis -- the Sephardic Yaakov Meir and Ben-Zion Hai Uziel and
the Ashkenazic Abraham Isaac Kook and Isaac Herzog -- were major
figures with a dominant influence on the Yishuv and the Jewish
people.  Their heirs, whatever <I>halakhic</I> influence they have had,
have not been of the stature to be able to continue to wield
similar influence.</p><p align="justify">

To round out the picture, the universities, formally secular
institutions, not only enjoy the special status reserved by Jews
for institutions of learning but have, from the first, been
entrusted with the task of serving the Zionist enterprise.
Several employ professors in certain fields who have become the
principal articulators of non-Orthodox Jewish visions and
teachings associated with them, especially Zionism.  They are
governed and supported by the Jewish people as a whole through
their boards of trustees as well as by the State of Israel
through the Misrad HaHinuch and the Council of Higher Education,
and their own faculties and administrations.
</p><p align="justify">
The tasks of the <I>keter kehunah</I> are chiefly handled by the Misrad
HaDatot plus different instrumentalities of the <I>keter torah</I>.
Most are handled locally by the <I>moetzot datiot </I>(local religious
councils), formal local authorities established to serve local
religious needs such as <I>kashruth</I> inspection and supplementary
support for synagogues, <I>mikvaot</I> (ritual baths) and the like.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


Local authorities in Israel can be understood as <I>kehillot
</I>following a similar model.  The terminology of
local government parallels that of the state government.  A
municipality is either an <I>ir</I> (city, a biblical term), a <I>moetzah
mekomit</I> (local council), or a <I>moetzah azorit </I>(regional council).
The mayor is <I>rosh ha'ir</I> (head of the city) or <I>rosh ha'moetzah
</I>(head of the council).  The legislative body is always the
<I>moetzah</I>.  The other terminology is the same.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

The proportional representation system makes the Knesset broadly
representative of the organized political groups in the polity.
Every <I>memshalah</I> is a coalition of parties, established under a
formal coalition agreement (<I>heskem</I>) negotiated by the parties.
It must function in such a way as to allow its members much
latitude and enable them to gain rewards for their constituents
in return for participating in the coalition.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT> The Knesset
frequently functions more as a sounding board for the broader
interests of Israel and the Jewish people than as a legislative
assembly in the conventional parliamentary sense.</p><p align="justify">



This fits well with the traditional role of the principal
political assemblies of the Jewish people, which were designed to
reflect the views of the <I>edah</I> and to reach an operative consensus
on issues rather than simply legislate.  The <I>memshalah</I> is
responsible for formulating legislation and policy that can be
modified by the Knesset, but are rarely rejected unless the
responsible ministry has utterly failed to do its homework.  The
Knesset exercises most of its power through its committee system,
something uncharacteristic of most parliaments but a classic
aspect of congressional government.  Committees are the source of
such independence as the Knesset has vis-a-vis the <I>memshalah</I> and
are so structured as to give the opposition members significant
weight so that they will help guarantee that independence.</p><p align="justify">


In the local arena, the law was amended in the late 1970s to
institute direct election of mayors.  This could have led to the
introduction of a presidential system in the local arena, with
the mayor substantially independent of his council and with
nearly full authority to control the executive branch.  In fact,
the weight of tradition has led mayors to organize coalitions
based on the distribution of seats in their local councils in a
manner like the system in the state arena.  The relationship
between the Knesset and <I>memshalah</I> and council and executive is
best described as that of two unequal congressional bodies that
nevertheless check and balance each other.</p><p align="justify">


Israel is formally a secular, democratic state, the only one in
the Middle East besides Turkey, but its calendar and rhythm are
deliberately Jewish in the same way that the calendars and
rhythms of the states of the Christian world are Christian, and
of the Muslim world, Muslim.  The Sabbath and Jewish holidays are
official days of rest in Israel, albeit on social rather than
religious grounds.  Public and government bodies display Jewish
symbols, whether <I>mezzuzot</I> on every doorpost in every public
building or Hanukkah lights on top of every city hall at the
appropriate season.  The Israel Defense Forces, El Al - the
national airline, and all other public institutions maintain
Jewish dietary laws and an agreed-on modicum of Sabbath
observance.  Hebrew is the official and principal language of the
country (Arabic is also an official language and English a
recognized one).  Because language is the principal bearer of
culture, it strengthens the Jewish cultural identity of the
state.  Even the most secular Israeli public figures use biblical
and talmudic expressions in their speeches and discussions as a
matter of second nature.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>            Israel as a State of the Jewish People<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT>
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

All the evidence indicates that a very large majority of the Jews
of Israel view it as the state of the Jewish people.  Every
coalition agreement forming a government reaffirms this view as
the official policy of the government and the state.  True, a
small but vocal minority rejects this understanding.  But no
matter how vocal, it is small and appears to be growing smaller,
having reached its high point in the late 1950s and early 1960s
when <I>mamlakhtiut</I> was also at its apex.  The trend toward the
separation of Israel from the Jewish people was strong then and
had at least the latent sympathy even of much of the
establishment.
</p><p align="justify">

The majority, who view Israel as the state of the Jewish people,
are of two orientations: those who see the Jewish people of
Israel as practically coterminous with the Jewish people and
those who see the state as the center of a larger people.  The
first group is mindful of the existence of the diaspora but
considers it to be merely an appendage of the state, probably
transitory, either because diaspora Jews will be compelled to
move to Israel sooner or later because of anti-Semitism or
because they will assimilate into the societies in which they are
located.  From this perspective, practically speaking, the Jews
who count are the Jews of Israel.
</p><p align="justify">

Those in the second group not only recognize that the diaspora
will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, but that
Israel has only one quarter of the Jews in the world while the
largest Jewish community, that of the United States, has over two
million more Jews than the Jewish state.  They argue that,
because Israel is the only independent Jewish state and is the
focal point of Jewish tradition, it is central to Jewish
existence and far more important than mere numbers would
indicate.  However, they are also prepared to see it as one unit
in a polity that has others.
</p><p align="justify">

The second view is more accurate.  Even if weakened by
assimilation, at least some diaspora communities will continue to
be organized and powerful in their own right.  This is not to
suggest that such communities will be independent of Israel; to
the contrary, they are strengthened by Israel (just as the
reverse is true).  The Jewish world is too interdependent for any
other course, as a body politic its parts interact to strengthen
one another.  Perhaps ironically, some diaspora communities will
be strengthened by Israeli <I>yordim</I> (emigres), some of whom have
assumed important positions in those communities.  Thus Israel is
both a Jewish state sui generis and a Jewish community related to
other Jewish communities on what could be considered a federal
basis. Moreover, most Israeli Jews see the fostering of that
relationship as one task of the state.</p><p align="justify">


The principal institutional manifestations of this relationship
are the <I>mosdot leumi'im</I>, national institutions functioning in the
state's territory.  In addition to the Jewish Agency and the
World Zionist Organization, responsible for aliyah and the
settlement of the land and the Zionist education of Jews in
Israel and outside, and the Jewish National Fund (JNF),
responsible for land development wherever the Israel Lands
Authority is not empowered to act, there are other national
institutions.  Technically, Bank Leumi, as the bank of the World
Zionist Organization, is one, as is El Al, which is jointly owned
by the state and the Jewish Agency and is known as the national
airline.  The Hebrew University and the other universities, a
major share of whose funding and boards of governors are drawn
from the Jewish community worldwide, and the National Library on
the Hebrew University campus are also.</p><p align="justify">


The relationship between the Jewish Agency and the State of
Israel was institutionalized in the 1952 covenant between the
World Zionist Organization and the state, ratified by the
Knesset.  Through the Agency and its related organizations, the
Jewish people undertake settlement, social, and educational
projects throughout Israel, in rural and urban areas and often in
cooperation with the local authorities.  The different bodies
have regional and local offices throughout the country that serve
local populations as if they were government agencies.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

The relationship between the state, the Agency, and the
universities has been institutionalized through the state's
Council for Higher Education.  Budgeting and policy-making are
shared by the Council, the universities' "national" governing
boards, and each university's senate.  These are roughly the
equivalent of state, federal, and local bodies, if one were to
translate them into political terminology.  Tel Aviv, Haifa, and
Ben-Gurion Universities were founded by their municipalities,
which continue to make their contribution as well.  The others
also get some support from the budgets of the local governments
in whose jurisdictions they are located.</p><p align="justify">


The Israeli government also seeks to institutionalize the
relationship between Israel and the diaspora communities through
common organizations and associations structured along
functional, professional, ideological, and social lines.  So,
too, Israelis are represented in many world Jewish bodies through
a network of nongovernmental organizations functioning in the
state, such as the Israel section of the World Jewish Congress,
the Israel Council of the World Zionist Organization, and the
like.
</p><p align="justify">

The Law of Return guarantees every Jew (except those fleeing
criminal prosecution) the right of entry into Israel and
immediate citizenship; in effect it obligates the state and local
governments to provide all services to all Jewish immigrants from
the moment of their settlement.  (Because of the dominant
political culture, such services and benefits are extended
immediately to all those accepted as residents of the state.)
There is much misunderstanding about the Law of Return.  Israel
has immigration laws like those of other countries, with permits
issued upon application and naturalization following in due
course.  However, because Israel is considered the state of the
Jewish people, Jews enter as if they were engaging in interstate
immigration in the American manner.  Similar laws hold true in
other countries for those considered their nationals even if born
outside their borders.

<H3><CENTER>              Israel in the Context of World Jewry
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Sometime between 1946 and 1949, the postmodern epoch began.  For
the Jewish people, the Holocaust and the establishment of the
State of Israel provided the pair of decisive events that marked
the crossing of the watershed into the postmodern world.  In the
process, the entire basis of the Jewish polity was radically
changed, the locus of Jewish life shifted, and virtually every
organized Jewish community was reconstituted in some way. The
restoration of the Jewish state added a new factor to the <I>edah</I>,
creating a new focus of Jewish energy and concern precisely at
the moment when the older foci had reached the end of their
ability to attract most Jews.  As the 1967 crisis demonstrated
decisively, Israel was not simply another Jewish community in the
constellation but the center of the world for Jews.</p><p align="justify">


In the diaspora, the centers of Jewish life had shifted
decisively away from Europe to North America.  Immediately after
the war, continental Europe ranked behind Latin America, North
Africa, and Great Britain, as a force in Jewish life.  Its Jews
were almost entirely dependent on financial and technical
assistance from the United States and Israel.  Except for those
in the Moslem countries that were soon virtually to disappear,
the major functioning Jewish communities all had acquired
sufficient size to become significant factors on the Jewish scene
only within the previous two generations.  In many cases, the
original shapers of those communities were still alive, and many
were still the actual community leaders.  The Jewish world had
been willy-nilly thrown back to a pioneering stage.
</p><p align="justify">

This new epoch is still in its early years, hardly more than a
single generation old; hence, its character is still in its
formative stages.  Nevertheless, with the establishment of the
State of Israel in 1948 the Jewish polity began a constitutional
change of revolutionary proportions, inaugurating a new epoch in
Jewish constitutional history.  For the first time in almost two
millennia, the Jewish people were presented with the opportunity
to attain citizenship in their own state.  Israel's very first
law (<I>Hok HaShevut</I> -- the Law of Return) specified that every Jew
had a right to settle in Israel and automatically acquire Israeli
citizenship.
</p><p align="justify">

To date, only a fraction of the<I> edah</I> have taken advantage of
Israel's availability.  Most continue to live in the lands of the
diaspora of their own free will.  Hence the dominant structural
characteristic of the<I> edah</I> continues to be the absence of a
binding, all-embracing political framework, although it now has a
focus.  The State of Israel and its various organs have a strong
claim to preeminence in fields that touch on every aspect of
Jewish communal life.  The Israeli leadership have argued
consistently that Israel is qualitatively different from the
diaspora and hence its centrality must be acknowledged.  The
American Jewish leadership, in particular, have taken the
position that Israel is no more than first among equals.
Nevertheless, the reestablishment of a Jewish state has
crystallized the <I>edah</I> as a polity, restoring a sense of political
involvement among Jews and shaping a new institutional framework
in which the business of the <I>edah</I> is conducted.
</p><p align="justify">

The diffusion of authority and influence which continues to
characterize the structure of the <I>edah</I> and its components has
taken various forms in the new epoch.  The <I>keter malkhut</I> has been
transformed into a network of single and multipurpose functional
authorities, most of which do not aspire to do more than serve
their particular functions, but all of which acknowledge the
place of the State of Israel at the fulcrum of the network.  The
<I>keter kehunah</I> has become a conglomeration of synagogue movements
and their rabbinates, who are mainly responsible for ritual and
pastoral functions.  Each manages--independently--various ritual
functions in a manner it deems appropriate to its own traditions,
perspectives, and environment.  That each of these movements has
established a framework with worldwide aspirations, such as the
World Union for Progressive Judaism and the World Council of
synagogues, merely underlines the new organizational character of
the<I> edah</I>.
</p><p align="justify">

Sectoral segmentation is most pronounced in the keter torah.
Contemporary Jews take their cues in this domain from a
kaleidoscopic spectrum of authorities.  Their range stretches
from the Jewish professors and scholars who influence
contemporary Jews' understanding of what is expected of them as
Jews to the rabbinical leadership of the Conservative and Reform
camps, who may use the traditional devices for ruling on matters
of Torah but often in untraditional ways; to the heads of the
very traditional yeshivot and the rebbes of various emigre
Hassidic communities who have reestablished themselves in the
principal cities of Israel and the United States from which they
have developed multicountry networks.</p><p align="justify">


The fragmentation of the <I>keter torah</I> is both a reflection and an
expression of the absence yet of a clear cut, commonly accepted
constitutional basis for the entire <I>edah</I>.  The tendency toward a
wide variety of interpretations of the Torah which emerged during
the modern epoch, has now become exacerbated.  It is a sign of
the times that if the Torah is to be included in the definition
of the constitution, it has to be reinterpreted for a majority of
Jews.  The reality is that the norms by which Jews live their
lives are interpreted through various prisms, of which the
traditional prism is now only one.  Still, it seems that most
Jews perceive the Torah to be a constitutional referent in some
way.</p><p align="justify">


This fragmentation is further reflected in the multiplicity of
camps and parties which exert influence on the life of the <I>edah
</I>and its constituents.  Broadly speaking, the principal camps can
be termed the Orthodox (modern and ultra) and the Masorati
(traditional) who see themselves as continuing the ways of the
Pharisees, the Liberal religious, and the Neo-Sadducees.  The
last includes Israelis seeking to express their Judaism through
Israeli Jewry's emerging civil religion--Zionists--and those
diaspora Jews who find their best means of Jewish expression in
the communal institutions. These camps are separate but not
mutually exclusive.   The Mizrahi
Party, for instance, straddles the Zionist and the Orthodox
camps, viewing its Zionism as one expression of its Orthodoxy.
Increasingly, too, do the Conservative (Masorati) and Reform
(Liberal) movements find themselves linked with Zionism.  At the
same time, the Neturei Karta, the secular Zionists, and the
surviving classical Reform elements remain separated in their
respective camps.</p><p align="justify">


During the first generation of Israeli statehood, the <I>keter
torah</I>, while institutionally present, was notably weak in matters
of Israeli governance.  The religious parties were either
peripheral, as in the case of the ultra-Orthodox, or reflections
of a slightly more Pharisaic version of the Labor-dominated 
<I>keter malkhut</I>, as is the case of the religious Zionists.  Indeed,
this writer was even led to question whether his theory that
every Jewish polity had to have an active <I>keter torah </I>would
continue to be valid in the postmodern, secular age.  Then in the
1980s the power of one expression of the <I>keter torah</I> unexpectedly
burst forth on the Israeli political scene with renewed energy
and force. This new burst of energy came from the haredim, most
of whom had remained relatively apathetic toward the politics of
the state they barely recognized prior to 1981.  Then they
discovered the benefits of involvement in Israeli politics, both
to protect the manifestations of adherance to Orthodox Judaism by
the state and its institutions and to gain financial support for
their growing population and its institutions.  
</p><p align="justify">
Because of the virtual tie between the two major parties, the
small ultra-Orthodox parties acquired a role in the
balance-of-power beyond the wildest dreams of the religious
Zionist parties and were able to determine, if not dictate, which
of the two large parties would be able to form a governing
coalition.  Of course the force and visibility of their demands
and the degree to which their respective councils of sages and
rebbes determined the direction in which their votes would be
cast catapulted the keter torah into the Israeli political arena
with new force.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>             Israel as a State in the Land of Israel
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

The present State of Israel, with or without the territories
occupied as a result of the Six-Day War, does not encompass the
entire land of Israel, what Aryeh Eliav--noted for his
willingness to cede the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 to
a Palestinian state--has referred to as "the land of the twelve
tribes."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT>  Recognizing this does not mean espousing irredentism.
The historical record shows that, even in the heyday of Jewish
national existence in the land, it was more common than not for
the land to be divided among several polities.  Only the Davidic
and Hasmonean empires briefly succeeded in bringing the whole of
Eretz Israel under a single Jewish government, at a price that
few Israelis would wish to pay.  Thus, although reestablishing
Jewish national existence in the land should be seen as a proper
exercise of the Jewish people's religious and historical rights,
complete redemption of the land may well be, in traditional
religious terms, "forcing the end," that is to say, attempting
more than can be achieved through human agency alone.
</p><p align="justify">

That the State of Israel embraces less than the Land of Israel
has several important implications.  First, there is a difference
between the religious commitment to the land and loyalty to the
state; the two are not identical.  A Jew should love Eretz Israel
in its entirety beyond the boundaries of the State of Israel.
From a religious perspective, a good Jew must be committed to the
state for what it is but should not make that commitment
monistic; it is part of one's multiple commitment to the land,
the people, the Torah, and God.  This further reduces the
tendency to view the state as an end in itself.  Many secular
Jews have emphasized, mistakenly, love of state as the equivalent
of love of country.  Religious Jews have not had that problem to
the same extent, though some have also been susceptible to it.
</p><p align="justify">
Recognizing that Eretz Israel must presently be shared with
another people does not require Jews to give up their love for
it.  Perhaps the day will come when peace permits the settlement
of Jews in all parts of the land, even outside the territories
embraced by the State of Israel.  Even if those Jews are citizens
of another state, the difference in their relationship to the
land will be there.  That is why Jordan excludes Jews as
residents--out of (misplaced) fear for the consequences of that
attachment.</p><BR>



<H3><CENTER>                  Israel as a Compound Polity<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
Many students of the Israeli political system have been misled by
the apparent simplicity of the state's government.  For those
familiar with Western European and American institutions, where
polities are well-nigh territorially based, government is
organized fairly simply on two or three levels or planes (state
and local, or federal, state, and local)' where the greatest
complexity is in the overlapping of local governments, the
Israeli political system is complex, in that it typifies the
region in which it is located and the people it serves.
</p><p align="justify">

The State of Israel is a compound in several ways.  First,
although conceived as a Jewish state, it is also compounded of
several different ethnoreligious minorities besides the Jewish
majority: Muslim Arabs, Christians, mostly Arab, divided into
several churches; Druse; Bahai; Circassians; and Samaritans, each
with its own socioreligious structure and legal status,
institutional frameworks, and government support.  In this
respect, Israel is but a more enlightened example of a phenomenon
among all Middle Eastern states: they have ethnic minorities that
either must be accommodated in this way (as was once true in
Lebanon), severely repressed (as in the case of the Kurds in
Iraq), expelled (as were the Jews in several Arab states), or
destroyed (as were the Armenians in Turkey).  In a sense, this
represents a partial adaptation of the millet system of Ottoman
times and earlier, in which each group was constituted as a
separate community with internal autonomy.
</p><p align="justify">

Among the minorities, religious belief and practice is high and
even among the Jewish majority it is significant, with perhaps
one-fourth of the population quite religious in practice and
another 40 to 50 percent selective observers of Jewish tradition.
Even many of the so-called secular Jews expect to express their
Jewishness through certain religious symbols and accept the
institutionalization of the Jewish religion as befitting a Jewish
state.  This gives the institutions of the <I>keter torah</I> and <I>keter
kehunah</I> added authority and power.</p><p align="justify">


The religious communities have their own institutional
structures, recognized, and in many cases, chosen under state law
because they provide state-supported services.  Thus each
religious community has its own religious courts whose judges
hold commissions from the state on the basis of qualifications
determined by each religious community.  They are selected by the
appropriate bodies of each religious community under procedures
provided by state law.  These courts administer the religious
laws of their community, each of which has its own legal system
for matters of personal status.  As understood by the Knesset and
the Israeli Supreme Court, religious law stands in relationship
to the secular law of Israel roughly as state law stands in
relationship to federal law in a federation with a dual legal
system.  That is to say, it is distinct, tends to be exclusive in
its sphere, but is held to certain national tests in its
application.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

For the state, these religious groups obtain their powers through
state law, but for the religious communities their powers flow
directly from God and their law represents Divine will.  For
them (and this is true for the Jewish religious authorities as
much as for any of the others), the state should have only a
minimal role in determining their powers other than that to which
they are willing to acquiesce.  It would be correct to estimate
that one-third of Israelis hold the religious law of their
communities in higher regard than the law of the state, including
a small group of Jews, perhaps several hundred, who reject
state law altogether.</p><p align="justify">


The Jewish community in Israel is compounded of communities of
culture and communities of interest.  There are two kinds of
communities of interest: those with a religious or ideological
base, usually referred to as movements, and those whose concerns
are primarily with the management of power or the securing of
economic or social goals.  These communities of interest are
reasonably well known, although perhaps too little attention has
been paid to how they relate to each other and have since the
beginning of the Zionist enterprise.  Thus the different groups
of socialist Zionists, each with its ideology, began to erect
their settlements and institutions in the country.  Paralleling
them were Zionists with a liberal (in the European sense)
ideology and others whose ideology was primarily derived from
traditional religion, ranging from religious socialists who based
a modern collectivist ideology on ancient religious sources, to
the religious right that would not accept any kind of secular
behavior in the state-to-be.
</p><p align="justify">

Each of these movements, except the extreme religious right
(which has its own comprehensive organization) and Communist
left, sought to create a comprehensive range of institutions, a
kind of nonterritorial state of its own within the framework of
the Zionist effort.  They also wanted the effort to succeed, so
they federated in roof organizations and institutions through
which they could pursue the common objective, even while
contesting with one another about the shape of the state to come
and the vision that would inform it.  This federation of
movements became the basis of the party system, which organized
and informed Israel's political system.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


The transition from the settlement stage when ideological
democracy was dominant to a stage of rootedness when
territoriality asserts itself has since considerably transformed
the system. The original consociational framework has given way
to one in which the parties are no longer comprehensive nor do
they seek to be.  Nevertheless, the state's institutional
infrastructure continues to reflect those prestate federal
arrangements through the party control of even ostensibly neutral
government offices, state and municipally owned companies,
cooperatives, and voluntary bodies which are allocated by party
no less than in the overtly political institutions.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

Today, as in the past, the country is divided into three "camps":
the Labor camp, the National (as the heir of the earlier
civil--in Hebrew, <I>ezrahi</I>) camp, and the religious camp.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT>  With
all the changes that have taken place in recent years, including
the great weakening of concern with parties and ideologies in the
Israeli body politic, these three camps persist.  They persist
partly for party political reasons and partly as a reflection of
the real divisions that separate Israel's political activists,
even if they are unideological.
</p><p align="justify">

Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the three camps do not
relate to one another on a left-right continuum but stand in
something like a triangular relationship to one another.  For a long time, preoccupation with European models
prevented students of Israeli politics from seeing that there
never was a time when Israel, and the Zionist movement before it,
did not operate on that basis.  Thus for certain purposes, each
camp is left or right depending on what aspect of its particular
Zionist vision is involved.</p><p align="justify"><p align="justify">


The camps are divided into parties, in some cases along
left-right lines, often antagonistic to one another.  The size of
each camp is not fixed, either in relation to the total
population or to other camps, but whatever the fluctuations, the
camps persist.  There persistence is reflected in the stability
of camp (as distinct from party) allegiance in Knesset elections.</p><p align="justify">


At one time, almost all services provided citizens were provided
through the parties, or, for Labor, through the Histadrut, which
united the Labor camp.  Again the analogy to a federal system is
apt.  Just as in a federal territorial polity one must be a
resident of a state to avail oneself of the services of the
polity, so, too, in prestate Israel it was necessary to be linked
to a party or camp.
</p><p align="justify">

With the establishment of the state, the government took over
more and more of the services, beginning with the military
services (until 1948, the movements actually had separate
paramilitary formations), continuing with the schools (which were
divided into trends to accommodate the different social,
political, and religious attitudes within the Yishuv), and most
social services.  The parties or camps, however, still control
sports (teams in all league sports, for example, are organized by
party, although the divisions have become meaningless now that
the players are recruited strictly by ability), health insurance,
ordinary medical facilities, and banking.  Even those functions
that have been absorbed by the formal institutions of government
maintain an informal division by party key for employment
purposes.</p><p align="justify">

Today these manifestations of the old divisions are diminishing.
More and more services are provided neutrally by the state or
local governments or, more often, through cooperative
arrangements involving the two.  Party influence is strongest in
the government structure and primarily touches those who pursue
public careers rather than the public at large, although in a
government-permeated society this is a significant bastion of
party strength.
</p><p align="justify">
The raison d'etre for many of the original ideological divisions
has so weakened that only in the religious camp do ideological
justifications remain strong enough to create demands of prestate
intensity, and they are accommodated by allowing parallel
institutions in many fields--schools are the best example.  The
expectation is that, aside from the division between the strictly
religious and the non- or not-so religious, the ideological
divisions will become weaker unless there is a strong upsurge of
secular ideology but not necessarily disappear.  In part, they
are being replaced by new issue and cultural orientations that
continue to give each camp its identity but without the earlier
institutional apparatus.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


Similarly, those communities that acquired a primarily
territorial identity such as cities and towns are becoming
increasingly important as the polity makes the transition from
its ideologically rooted founding to being more settled.
Whatever the criticism sometimes raised against territorially
based communities, it is generally recognized that the
territorial expression of interests is natural to any society and
is reenforced by the strong Zionist desire to achieve greater
rootedness in the country.  The political parties may oppose the
shift to territorially based representation on ostensibly
ideological grounds, but they do so primarily because of
self-interest, to protect their power bases.</p><p align="justify">


Circumstances have led to the emergence of a state that is more
or less organized to accommodate some of the complexities of its
population but in a formal structure borrowed from another
context.  That structure goes against the grain of most of the
realities of the Israeli society and politics and has had to be
accommodated to those realities by a heavy reliance on extralegal
methods.  The mismatch has led to an increasing impairment in the
governance of the state, of which one manifestation is a tendency
to ignore the law to make things work.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

Although something can be said for having allowed the system to
develop pragmatically, as it has, focusing on the relationships
desired in each instance rather than in the formalities of the
structure, a point comes where structure is crucial, if only
because of how it influences relationships.  Israel has now
reached that point, evidenced by the demands for structural
reform that abound as many Israelis have begun to perceive, even
dimly, that the structure of their governing institutions does
not square with their expectations as citizens.  The diehard
resistance to those structural changes by those in power only
adds weight to the evidence.</p><p align="justify">


Much of the structure also goes against the grain of the Jewish
political tradition.  This is not readily perceived by a
population that remains unaware of that tradition, even though it
is the effect of the behavioral aspects of that tradition on a
structure derived from nineteenth-century European models that
has led to the mismatch.  Nor are Israelis particularly aware
that their polity is compounded.  Even those who would be, for
the most part look at the system through glasses colored by
nonindigenous ideologies or methodologies that lead them away
from a proper perception of the reality in which they live.  Thus
many in the religious camp have not come to grips with the
pluralistic compound in the state, the camps have not come to
grips with the changed character of the emerging territorial
democracy, and the Jewish majority is only beginning to come to
grips with the existence of a substantial and growing Arab
minority.</p><p align="justify">

After the Six-Day War, the camps seemed to be diminishing as
political as well as social factors in Israeli society.  The
movement from ideological to territorial democracy was
predominant in the first generation of Israeli statehood
(1948-1977).  David Ben-Gurion led the way after 1948 in his
emphasis on <I>mamlakhtiut</I> (statism) in place of the earlier
political ideologies, state provision of public services
previously provided by the parties or camps, and a shift from
socialism to a quasi-state capitalism in the economic sphere for
pragmatic reasons.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT>  But he merely prefigured and strengthened
what is a natural phenomenon in any new society: the decline of
the founding ideologies as the society takes shape and the
founders are succeeded by later generations who are where they
are because they were born there and not because they have chosen
to be builders of a new society because of prior ideological
motivation.  Every new society has passed through a similar
transformation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

By the late 1960s, the new political leadership was, with a few
exceptions, also nonideological, with leanings in one direction
or another derived from the old ideologies, but basically
pragmatic in orientation and concerned with new problems about
which the old ideologies had little to say.  Although the parties
kept up some pretense of ideological commitment, almost everyone
knew that this was merely a front designed to pay due obeisance
to the <I>halutzic</I> spirit of the past.  This was most true of the
Labor Party, which had become a broad-based coalition of sectors
and factions.  It was least true of the religious parties which
had living ideologies from which they drew, although there, too,
the largest--the National Religious Party (NRP)--had become so
pragmatic in practice that its ideology was only minimally
relevant.
</p><p align="justify">

Hence, it was not surprising that after the Six-Day War, the
emergence of new issues about the future of the administered
territories and the negotiation of peace with the Arabs should
lead to the breaking off of fringe elements from one camp and
their movement to another, which had not previously happened in
Israeli politics.  That, plus the defection of many previously
Labor voters to the Likud and the tendency of the young to vote
Likud no matter how their parents voted, led many to believe that
the camps were breaking down.  Indeed, in time, the twin issues
of land and peace generated their own partisan movements--Gush
Emunim and Shalom Achshav--and moved to center stage in the
electoral process.
</p><p align="justify">

The 1984 elections suggested that matters were not so simple.  It
is true that the old ideologies faded further, yet the camps
reemerged around the new ones, two in particular: peace and the
territories, and state and religion.  Voter shifts and party
divisions still were and are more likely within camps than across
them. Thus the Labor camp embraces the Labor Party, Mapam (which
broke its alliance with the Labor Party in 1984 rather than enter
the national unity government) and Shulamit Aloni's Citizens'
Rights Movement, a Labor Party breakaway now positioning itself
as Israel's "new left."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

The Likud was founded as an amalgam of the two major parties of
the civil (now national) camp--Herut and the Liberals--and
acquired La'am in 1969, the one breakaway from the Labor camp
that moved as a body across camps.  In 1981, Tehiya broke away
from Likud, yet remained in the same camp.  So, too, did the
smaller fragments: Morasha, Ometz, and Moledet, which broke away
in 1984 and 1988.  All were identified by voters as being fully
within the national camp.</p><p align="justify">


Ezer Weizman broke away from Likud to found Yahad in 1984,
claiming to remain in the national camp.  His later decision to
join the Labor Party led to a negative response among his voters,
who never expected such a turn of events.  La'am subsequently
merged fully with Herut as did both of the 1984 breakaways.  As
Herut became dominant within it, the civil camp became more
nationalist and populist rather than liberal in character.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

Since the establishment of the state, the religious camp has won
between twelve and eighteen seats in every election, with the
number usually thirteen to sixteen.  On one occasion, almost the
entire camp was united; on others it was divided between two
parties: the National Religious Party and Agudath Israel.
Occasionally, Poalei Agudath Israel would run independently and
win a seat.  In 1984, the religious camp fragmented among five
parties that together won thirteen seats.  What is significant is
that all five--the NRP, Agudath Israel, Matzad-Morasha, Sephardi
Torah Guardians, and Tami--stayed within the same camp, however
hostile the relationships among them.  By 1988, Tami had
disappeared and Matzad-Morasha returned to the NRP.  The camp's
fissiparous tendencies remained strong, however, as both the NRP
and Agudat Israel split further, adding Meimad and Degel HaTorah.
Nevertheless, the camp again reached its all-time high of 18
seats.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

If camps do not survive for ideological reasons, why do they?  I
would suggest that they have come to reflect different facets of
Israel's emerging political culture, especially voter affinities
in political expectations and style.  Political scientists have
referred to these as matters of "persuasion" rather than
ideology--a somewhat vague set of orientations rather than a
clear-cut doctrine specifying programs and goals.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT>  These
differences in persuasion are still effective in shaping the
configurations of Israeli politics and the limits of voter
change.  Such shifts as are taking place, among younger voters
and Sephardim (the two groups overlap considerably), reflect a
sorting out of persuasions because of generational change.
</p><p align="justify">
By competing within a shared political framework, the camps keep
their very real differences in orientation from tearing the state
apart.  In this respect, they continue to be the mechanism for
maintaining national unity that their Zionist founders intended.
They are the institutional mechanisms for establishing,
maintaining, and adjusting Israel's "social contract" (better
termed "national compact"), linking the opposed groups within the
polity in a kind of Hobbesian covenant of civil peace.

<H3><CENTER>              The Conflict of Cultural Inheritances
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

The political culture of Israel is compounded of several elements
that have yet to become fully integrated.  Three major political
strands can be isolated.  The most visible was the <I>etatist</I>
political culture imported from eastern and central Europe by
those of the pioneering generation who had learned to conceive of
state and government in classical European terms and built into
the state's institutions at every turn.  Its four salient
elements, for our purposes, are: (1) a strong
statist-bureaucratic orientation, (2) a perception of public
officials as standing in a superior relationship to the general
public by virtue of their role as servants of the (reified)
state, (3) expectations of heavy state involvement in the
economic and social spheres as normal and even desirable, and (4)
strong support for centralization of power. Political
organization is expected to be centralized, hierarchical, and
bureaucratic.  While most of this went against the Jewish
political tradition in every respect and against the ideology of
the <I>halutzim</I> which emphasized participatory democracy in
face-to-face communities and cooperative institutions, in the end
it was their political cultural orientation of those who had
assimilated European modes which shaped their expectations of the
new state.</p><p align="justify">


The second political cultural strand was also imported.  Although
primarily associated in the public mind with Jewish immigrants
from west Asia and North Africa, it can be found among those
European Jews who came to Israel directly from the <I>shtetl</I> (the
Yiddish term for the east European townlet where the average Jew
lived at the turn of the century) or a <I>shtetl</I>-like environment
and were not previously acculturated to the larger European
environment.  This political culture also perceives the governing
authority as a powerful force existing outside and independent of
the people, but it sees government as more malevolent and more
limited, the private preserve of an elite, serving the interests
of that elite.  Government is perceived personally as a ruler
with whims rather than as the comprehensive and reified state of
the first political culture.  Individuals imbued with this
political culture perceive themselves to be subjects of the
state, not participating citizens.  As subjects they seek to
avoid contact with the government or anyone associated with it,
insofar as possible, for safety's sake.  When they must deal with
officials, they usually take a petitionary approach, humbly
requesting consideration of their needs and recognizing the
superior power of the official without necessarily endorsing his
authority.  The state is not looked upon as a vehicle that
provides services or social improvement.  Instead the hope is
that its role will be as limited as possible so that the rulers
will interfere in the lives of their subjects as little as
possible.
</p><p align="justify">

The third political cultural strand grows out of the indigenous
political experience of the Jewish people in their own
communities.  It is civic and republican in its orientation and
views the polity as a partnership of its members, who are equal
citizens and who are entitled to an equitable share of the
benefits resulting from the pooling of common resources.  There
is no reified state , nor do rulers rule by whim.  The leaders of
the community are perceived to be responsible to its members, who
entrust the leaders with authority and have their own civic
obligations to fulfill.  The role of the community in dealing
with human needs is perceived to be substantial but never
all-embracing.</p><p align="justify">


Whereas the first two political cultures see authority and power
as hierarchical, Jewish political culture sees it as federal.  In
this view, it is the product of a series of covenants reaching
down to the immediate compacts that establish individual
communities in the body civic or politic and affirm the equality
of the partners and the authority of the institutions they serve.</p><p align="justify">


Though this strand is as old as the Jewish people, the
circumstances of Jewish political life since the loss of
independence some two thousand years ago, and particularly since
the rise of the modern nation-state in the last three hundred
years, were such that Jewish communities could not preserve their
political autonomy unadulterated.  In those years, Jews lost
their own political culture as they assimilated--willingly or
forceably--into the host societies in which they found
themselves.  This was true from Germany to Algeria, from the
United States to Iran. Wherever Jews lived lives relatively
integrated into their host societies, they acquired the political
orientations of those societies.  Consequently, the Jewish strand
is frequently more latent than manifest.  Every Jewish community,
however, maintained some internal political organization, which
even when not conceived to be political by its members,
acculturated them into patterns of political behavior vis-a-vis
one another and the community.  This civic strand is spread
across almost the entire Jewish population of Israel, which means
that, more than any of the others, it provides common points of
reference and possibilities for communication among Jews from
widely different diaspora environments.</p><p align="justify">


To some extent, Israeli civil society is already in amalgam of
the three strands, with different institutions reflecting one
strand more than the others.  In other respects, the three stand
in tension and even conflict.  When the Zionists were called upon
to build their own state, they drew upon the only models they
knew.  More than that, their expectations of what statehood meant
virtually required them to adopt the institutions of the European
reified state, pointing to them with pride in the first flush of
statehood.  The further removed particular institutions were from
the necessity to mobilize popular support, consent, and
participation on a continuing basis, the more they mimicked
European (especially Jacobin) models.  Thus the Israeli
bureaucracy is European in style and structure, but the army--the
most fully Israeli institution--comes far closer to the model of
authoritative relationships rooted in Jewish political culture
emphasizing as it does leadership by example and discipline on
the basis of informed consent.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT> The subject strand, whose
legitimacy is in doubt everywhere, and which is rapidly
disappearing, remains visible, if at all, among certain strata in
the development towns.
</p><p align="justify">

Yet, underneath these, the upward thrust of the previously latent
Jewish political culture is becoming increasingly evident, though
far from unilinear in its progress.  Take the role of the Supreme
Court in relation to the Knesset.  Following European models, the
Knesset is formally the highest repository of authority or
political sovereignty in the state, with its supremacy specified
in law and taken for granted in practice.  Parliamentary systems
normally do not give their supreme courts power to declare acts
of parliament unconstitutional.  Therefore, Israel makes no
formal provision for judicial review of legislative acts of the
Knesset.
</p><p align="justify">
Courts, however, have always held authoritative positions in
Jewish political life, and Jewish political culture has
emphasized judicial decision making as being of the highest
importance.  The Supreme Court of Israel has taken its
obligations seriously and in 1969, asserted a limited power of
judicial review, effectively declaring an act of the Knesset to
be unconstitutional by holding that it was unenforceable.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT>  The
Knesset accepted the court's ruling and, in response, passed a
revised act designed to accommodate its constitutional
objections.  In doing so, it effectively affirmed at least a
limited power of judicial review as part of the state's
constitutional framework and moved Israel a step away from the
European models and closer to a model indigenous to the Israeli
situation.  Since then, the constitutional role of the Supreme
Court has continued to grow, with almost no opposition.  Today it
has a power of review somewhat different than, but hardly less
than, that of the Supreme Court of the United States.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

Though a common Israeli political culture is still in its
formative stages, some of its elements can already be identified.
First, there is the strong sense of national unity--one might say
embattled national unity-which pervades the country, the effect
of Israel's immediate security position and the history of Jewish
isolation and persecution in the larger world.  Because the
security situation is a continuation of one of the major problems
of Jewish history--that of survival--in a new context, this
element is rooted deeply in the psyches of and political culture
of all Jews, including Israelis.</p><p align="justify">


Similarly, a common sense of vocation or calling to some great
task, or at least a strong feeling of need for such a sense, is
inherited from Jewish political culture.  Israel, in that sense,
cannot merely exist for its citizens; it must be justified by
virtue of its contribution as a Jewish state, however defined.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT>
Until the 1950s, this sense of vocation was manifested through
the Zionist vision of rebuilding Israel to redeem the Jewish
people.  Since then it has become somewhat blurred as it has
become ideologically simplified and intellectually broadened.
The revival of elements of the Zionist mystique after 1967 gave
it new life for a few years, although by the late 1970s, there
was a strong feeling abroad that this sense of vocation needed
renewal. The early sympathy for Gush Emunim, even on the part of
those willing to exchange territory occupied as a result of the
war for real peace, reflected that sense in that the Gush was
seen as continuing the pioneering tradition of full commitment to
the Zionist vocation.  Subsequently, the ultra-Orthodox briefly
enjoyed the same positive response on the part of people for
renewal of their way of life, on the basis of their clear
vocational commitment, until their demands on the state became
excessive in the view of the less religious.  What was clear was
that Israelis, as Jews, took the need for a sense of vocation for
granted and felt uneasy when it was weak.</p><p align="justify">


The federal element (in the social even more than the political
sense) is an important part of Israel's emergent political
culture.  We have already noted the use of federal principles in
the foundation of the state's institutions.  These institutional
arrangements are the most visible manifestations of the federal
principles that permeate Israeli society and its political
culture, from its congregational religious organization to its
system of condominium housing.  Even though it has no
acknowledged federal structure in its polity, contractual
government, the consociational diffusion of power among its
political parties and movements, and negotiated collaboration are
elements of the Jewish political culture that are finding
expression, though imperfectly, in the restored Jewish state.</p><p align="justify">


Constitutionalism, republicanism, and desires for self-government
are also deeply rooted in the emergent political culture of
Israel.  Whatever the problems faced by the country, threats to
constitutional legitimacy or the republican form of government
are not among them.  This is so despite public statements in
certain quarters deploring Israel's lack of a "written
constitution."  Precisely because such threats are almost
unthinkable, we know that cultural rather than simply strategic
or expediential supports for constitutionalism and republicanism
are involved.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


The covenant idea, with its underlying premise that civil society
is really a partnership among the compacting individuals, is
basic to Israel as a new society in the modern sense and as the
heir to the Jewish political tradition.  The idea of
constitutional legitimacy flowing from covenantal consensus has
moved in an unbroken line from the Israelite tribal federation
through the <I>kehillot </I>of the diaspora to the kibbutzim of modern
Israel.  As a proper Jewish polity, the State of Israel was
inaugurated through a covenant which, as has been common since
1776, was called a Declaration of Independence.  That document,
the only one in the entire history of the state signed by every
political party from Agudath Israel to the Communists, presents
the state's founding consensus and the principles on which it is
built; neatly balancing Jewish historical aspirations,
traditional themes, and the universalism and pluralism of
modernity.  As such, it has acquired constitutional standing and
moral force in the eyes of the Israelis.  It is taught as the
embodiment of the principles of the Israeli polity.</p><p align="justify">


Beyond covenants, the Jewish political tradition also emphasizes
the ordering of the polity through a written constitution.  Here
Israel has had to confront a basic conflict, unresolvable under
contemporary conditions.  That is, whether the Torah as the
traditional constitution of the Jewish people must serve as the
basis for the state's basic law or whether Israel is to adopt a
modern civil (or secular) constitution.  Israel shares that
tradition and is committed to the adoption of a formal written
constitution and first tried to write one in 1949.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT> The first
Knesset was actually elected as a constituent assembly.  But this
basic disagreement prevents the comprehensive consummation of
this commitment.  The series of compromises involved in the
decision to postpone the writing of a constitution need not
concern us here.  Suffice it to say that, even without that basic
conflict, a reluctance growing out of just those problems of
creating a new political cultural synthesis indigenous to the new
society described above lay at the root of the decision.  The
problems of religion and state, the precise forms of political
institutions, the degree of government centralization and
intervention into the economy, and the extent to which individual
rights needed constitutional safeguards were basic constitutional
questions deemed worth deferring on that account.
</p><p align="justify">
Instead, a standing Constitutional, Legislative, and Judicial
Committee was established in the Knesset and charged with the
responsibility of drafting Basic Laws, chapter by chapter, for
submission to the Knesset.  Their approval, nominally by an
absolute majority of the Knesset (at least sixty-one votes) gives
them constitutional status.  In accord with the political theory
under which the state operates, the final document will be called
a Basic Law and not a constitution (a term apparently reserved
for use by the Jewish people as a whole).  
</p><p align="justify">

By 1989, nine Basic Laws had been enacted.  They and the other
documents deemed to have constitutional status are listed below.  Together, they constitute the great bulk of a full
constitution.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT>

By now, a constitutional tradition that goes beyond those
documents has taken root in the state.  Israel's constitution,
like the British, is not written in a single document although,
also like the British, it is based upon a set of constitutional
documents. These include the Proclamation of Independence of the
State, nine Basic Laws, the covenant between the State and the
World Zionist Organization/Jewish Agency, the Harari resolution
enacted by the Knesset in 1950 establishing the process of
constitution-making, and perhaps one or two other pieces of
legislation.  The essence of Israel's constitution, again like
the British, is its ancient constitutional tradition, as adapted
to contemporary conditions.  
</p><p align="justify">

Israel's Supreme Court has made this constitution operative
through judicial review and the Knesset has faithfully adhered to
the constitutional framework it has developed.  The way in which
that has been done reveals much of the way in which the ancient
tradition has been adapted.
</p><p align="justify">

In other matters, the shape of the emergent political culture is
more equivocal.  Impressionalist observation reveals that a
change is taking place in the relationship between the
bureaucracy and the public.  The bureaucrats may not be becoming
more efficient, but they are becoming less officious, accepting
their role as public servants rather than officials of the
state.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

The same equivocal situation prevails regarding the role of the
citizens.  Israelis generally assume that citizens should be
concerned with civic matters, and citizen participation in
elections as voters is particularly high.  Nevertheless, attempts
to develop widespread political participation beyond the
elections have run into difficulties because of the party system,
where centralized control and adherence to the ideological
symbols and forms of an earlier generation discourage
participation by those not "political" in Israeli parlance (that
is, those who do not make politics the overriding concern in
their lives).  This is changing slowly through public action and
the acts of many individual citizens which together are bridging
the gap between cultural expectations and accepted political
practice.</p><p align="justify">


So, too, the public's expectations of politicians are reasonably
high, except, perhaps, in matters involving party bargaining.
The people demand a high standard of behavior by those
they entrust with power, yet are still in the process of devising
ways to impose sanctions if they do not meet that standard.
Questions of political morality in this sense have become major
issues, beginning with the 1977 elections.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT>  This must be
understood in context.  Jews are not Puritans or Victorians but
they are civic-minded.
</p><p align="justify">
Following this writer's political cultural model developed
earlier, Jewish political culture is civic, republican, and
traditional. In Israel it has been modified to include a strong
statist strand.  Jews themselves approach government with a
moralistic outlook but at the same time are very individualistic
in their personal behavior and demands, accepting the discipline
of the community as binding only when they consent to it.  Jewish
individualism tends to be assertive as well, the less restraint
on it, the better; the more possibility for objections, the
better.  </p><p align="justify">


Balancing these moralistic and individualistic tendencies is a
strong sense of traditionalism which serves as an anchor and
restraint on both.  Traditionalism tends to be the source of a
certain conservatism in Jewish life.  This is not only true of
those who are religiously traditional.  There is nobody as
orthodox in his way as an old Jewish radical. In other words,
whatever ideology Jews adopt in a very short time becomes a
tradition, compelling its adherants to live intensively according
to what are perceived to be the dictates of its principles.
These must be followed according to precedent and without rocking
the boat, even though with their moralistic tendencies, Jews
constantly tend to look for improvement in the present situation
and reform, and with their individualistic ones Jews tend to be
liberal in matters of personal behavior.  
</p><p align="justify">

There is a tension, as it were, in all Jewish communities between
tradition, moralism, and individualism.  It is a tension that is
not and cannot be definitively overcome.  Rather it is a kind of
hopefully creative tension that helps define Jews as Jews.  In
every generation and in every community Jews try to adjust to it
as best they can. Israel is no exception.  All three strands are
very visible in the political attitudes and behavior of Israeli
Jews.  </p><p align="justify">


Finally, there is a tendency for Jews to have messianic
expectations and to approach political life with those
expectations before them. The Jewish willingness to fight for
messianic goals explains the intense commitment of so many Jews
to ideologies and causes.  A messianic commitment can lead to
fanaticism and there are no better fanatics than Jews.  Why?
Because to be messianic one has to have passion and to believe
passionately.  If one believes passionately that something is
right, one will go to almost any length to achieve it.  
</p><p align="justify">

Fortunately, Jews have been taught so strongly by the Torah and
by drawing on their own historical experience to minimize
violence that even the worst Jewish fanatics tend to stop when
their confrontations with other Jews come right up to the edge.
That has been a saving grace in contemporary Israel.  Every time
inter-Jewish conflicts have reached the point of incipient
violence, all segments of the Jewish population have recoiled
from crossing that line.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                       Political Response
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

In Israel representative government was originally conceived to
be government through representative institutions (that is,
parties and movements) rather than representative individuals.
This approach is now under some attack in a developing struggle
over the means of representation and the constitution of the
institutions themselves.
</p><p align="justify">
In the governing institutions themselves, in place of the
integration of powers common in parliamentary institutions there
is a continuing, if halting, trend toward separation of powers.
The government (cabinet) has become increasingly independent of
the Knesset and vice versa.  The ability of the government to
achieve independence is not difficult to fathom.  The central
problem in parliamentary systems all over the world is how to
make legislatures more than simply routine ratifiers of executive
proposals.</p><p align="justify">

Israel has not solved this problem, but it has developed and
institutionalized the unparliamentary device of standing
committees with areas of responsibility somewhat akin to the
American model that help the Knesset preserve some of its
independence--within the limits dictated by the parliamentary
system--and to shape government proposals into better
legislation.  These standing committees include representatives
of government and opposition parties.  Meeting behind closed
doors, they allow members of the minority parties to influence
legislation through their talents in a way that would be
impossible if they had to act openly in an arena where their
suggestions had to be judged on a partisan basis.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

The expansion of the bargaining arena must be considered another
aspect of republicanism in Israel.  As befits a society whose
origins lie so heavily in covenantal arrangements, bargaining and
negotiation are important features of Israel's political process,
though, as befits a society torn between formal institutions
representing the statist-bureaucratic political culture and
tendencies reflecting the others, much of the bargaining is
conducted despite the formal structure rather than in harmony
with it.  The Knesset committee system is simply one way in which
it has been institutionalized without overt political change.
The government is hardly more than a coalition of ministries, each
delegated broad powers by the Knesset and the realities of
coalition politics so that it can almost legislate in it its own
field.  These ministries negotiate with their clients, their
local government counterparts, the prime minister, with one
another, and the corresponding Knesset committees to implement
their programs.
</p><p align="justify">

Most Jews who have settled in Israel came after the state was
established.  They usually had low expectations about government
services and even lower expectations about their ability to
participate in or even influence government policies.  The
expectations of the Arabs were even lower.  Many of the Jews,
however, were ambivalent; they saw the new state as a messianic
achievement and hence expected its government to solve problems
in housing and employment in a paternalistic way.  In a sense,
their outlook reflected a temporary synthesis between subject and
statist political orientations.
</p><p align="justify">

As the population acquired an understanding of democratic
government, their demands intensified; some groups, once
passive, became almost unrestrained in their insistence on having
their way.  With this escalation of demands came an escalation of
complaints about how services were delivered.  Individuals would
seek to influence those responsible for service delivery when it
affected them, relying on personal contacts, but still did not
see themselves as participants in the general political process.
This has now changed, as most Israelis have been socialized into
the political system, and the subject political culture has
well-nigh disappeared.  A new synthesis of civic and statist
political orientations has emerged; whereby Israeli citizens
expect the state to be dominant in meeting their needs in a
framework of expected government responsiveness to a more
involved public.
</p><p align="justify">

Whether these changes can overcome bureaucratic inertia and the
formally hierarchical structure of the system is an open
question.  What is clear is that the political culture of Israel
acts in contradictory ways.  As much as the statist aspect is a
force, it acts as a strong bulwark against the myriad of explicit
and implicit contractual arrangements and the accompanying
bargaining and negotiation that inform the system.  As the civic
aspect becomes stronger, it acts as a catalyst for change.
Perhaps as the Israeli political culture becomes more consistent
and harmonious, the combination will prove to be unworkable and
one aspect or another will undergo serious modifications, but
there is no reason to expect real change in the near future.

<H3><CENTER>                      Religion and Politics
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

Last in the discussion of Israel as a Jewish state is the
operational relationship between religion and politics within it.
Increasingly, Jewish religion has become important in Israel's
civic culture.  The movement in this direction is unmistakable.
Relations between religion and politics in Israel can be
understood only by understanding the five forms of religious
expression influential in the state today.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

First, there is mainstream Orthodox Judaism as reflected by the
established organs linked to the state.  These include the chief
rabbinate, the local religious councils, the rabbinical courts,
and the state religious educational system.  For the most part,
this is the religion represented by the National Religious Party,
which has been a coalition partner in every lasting government
since the state was established, and even before.  It has
exercised a predominant, though by no means exclusive, influence
over the public expression of religion in Israel.</p><p align="justify">


Second, there is the popular religion of the broad public, a
combination of residual folk traditions, of commonly accepted
Jewish practices, and elements of an Israeli civil religion.
Even though no more than a quarter of Israelis define themselves
as <I>dati</I> (religious), which in the Israeli context means Orthodox,
probably the largest single body of Israelis--the estimates are
40 to 50 percent--define themselves as <I>masorti</I> (traditional).
For the Israelis, that is an umbrella term which includes people
highly observant by any standards, those who simply maintain
certain home customs, and those who observe almost nothing but
consider themselves believers.  Even among the 25 percent who
define themselves as <I>hiloni</I> (secular), many retain substantial
elements of folk religion in their lives--certain Sabbath
observances in the home, avoidance of overt mixing of meat and
milk, and the like--though they will define themselves as secular
because, for them, these practices represent a comfortable kind
of "Jewishness" rather than manifestations of religious belief.
Popular religion is well rooted in Israel, in almost every
quarter.  It is undergoing radical change now, because of the
transformation of many of the roughly 55 percent of Israelis of
Afro-Asian backgrounds, who now are losing their traditional ways
as did so many of the Jews who came from European backgrounds a
generation or two earlier.</p><p align="justify">


Third, there is the civil religion.  In a sense, civil religion
represents the point of intersection between establishment and
popular religion.  It reflects the emergence of a civil religion
that is grounded in traditional Judaism but is not traditional
religion, what I have elsewhere described as the reemergence in
new ways of Sadducean Judaism, the civil religion in Israel
before the destruction of the Second Commonwealth and the great
Jewish dispersion.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT>  In this respect it is different from the
talmudic or Pharisaic Judaism embodied by Israel's establishment
religion and which was the dominant Jewish religious expression
for at least sixteen hundred years.  This neo-Sadduceanism is
based on the centrality of Jewish public life for the expression
of Judaism.  The developing civil religion in Israel tries to
make sacred those expressions of Jewish moralistic nationalism
associated with the state and to infuse them with traditional
religious forms.
</p><p align="justify">

There was always a degree of this, when even the most secularist
halutzim took Jewish festivals and reinterpreted them in ways
that gave expression to the values of the Zionist revival.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT>  In
recent years, celebrations that were entirely secular even when
they relied on adaptations of traditional Jewish forms are being
fused with Jewish religious symbolism and modes of behavior.  For
example, Israeli Independence Day has increasingly taken on the
elements of a religious holiday.  It is expected that the
president of the state and the prime minister will go to evening
and morning religious services on that day.  Those services,
parts of the regular daily prayer cycle, now include recitation
of traditional prayers of praise and thanksgiving for Israel's
independence.  The religious establishment is also trying to
develop some kind of recognition of Israeli Independence Day as a
holiday that can be institutionalized in the Jewish calendar.
Jerusalem Day, the anniversary of the liberation of the Old City
and the Temple Mount according to the Jewish calendar, is also
acquiring the status of a religious holiday.
</p><p align="justify">
Fourth, there is ultra-Orthodox religion, so called because it is
even more extreme in its expression of classic talmudic Judaism
than establishment religion.  It is most visible through the
people who make the headlines by throwing stones at autos that
travel through or near their neighborhoods on the Sabbath, who
protest the immodesty of women dressed in modern fashion, and the
like.  They number a few thousand at most by the broadest
definition.  Most of the ultra-Orthodox community, comprising
several hundred thousand people, are counted among Agudath
Israel, the yeshiva world, and the numerous Hassidic sects that
express themselves through normal political and social channels
and have, especially in recent years, entered the political
processes through their own political parties.</p><p align="justify">

The ultra-Orthodox are the ultimate Perushim (Pharisees) in their
commitment to the dominance of the <I>keter torah</I>.  Their vigorous
activity and expanded role in the political arena has restored
the political voice of that domain (albeit though only one
expression of it) in ways thought to be no longer possible in a
secular democratic state.  As such, it reaffirms the basic
realities of Jewish politics in Israel as elsewhere.</p><p align="justify">


The ultra-Orthodox constitute a state within a state.  They
maintain their own schools, institutions, rabbinical courts, and
the like.  There are points of intersection between them and the
larger polity, but usually the polity tries to leave them alone,
to give them the same support as any other group, but to get them
to leave the state alone.  This is an uneasy relationship that
usually leads to periodic conflict around critical issues, but
this should not obscure the routine coexistence that exists at
other times.
</p><p align="justify">

Fifth, there is an emergent nonestablishment religious Judaism,
the Masorti (Conservative) and Yahadut Mitkademet (Reform
movements, which together exceed fifty congregations in strength.
With Masorati congregations now being formed throughout the
country, two Reform and one Masorti kibbutz on the land, and
Reform and Conservative rabbis now being ordained in Israel, it
is reasonable to conclude that these nonestablishment movements
are in the country to stay.  Although they are formally
unrecognized, there are increasing contacts between them and the
authorities in their daily activities and, in some respects, they
have tacit recognition.  For example, under a minister of
education from the National Religious Party, the Ministry of
Education supported the establishment of schools reflecting the
Masorti approach within the framework of the state educational
system.  The number of these schools is growing and more are
being established as the demand appears.  In the past, different
congregations obtained land for buildings from the municipal
authorities, and occasionally Masorti rabbis were authorized to
perform marriages.  As they have become more visible, these
quasi-formal steps have been discontinued under Orthodox
pressure.  Growing support for their activities in Israel comes
from the Jewish Agency in recogniton of their political strength
in the diaspora.
</p><p align="justify">

It is important to understand that the government of Israel does
not control or try to control the religious establishment.
Instead, the religious communities and groups use state
instrumentalities to further their own ends.  Headline-grabbing
events such as the exemption of Yeshiva students from military
service notwithstanding, day-to-day relations between the
religious and nonreligious in Israel are quite routine.  On the
other hand, the status quo established in 1947-48 is under
assault by a new generation that may be less militantly
secularist, but far more attuned to matters of personal
convenience, seeking recreational opportunities on the Sabbath
and holidays and the like.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>            The Religious Parties in Israeli Politics</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


Because of the pervasiveness of religious concerns in Israel,
most of the five groupings or positions find political expression
through the party system.  Where the need for political
expression is reinforced by the desire to benefit from the
instrumentalities of the state--whether institutional control,
financial support, recognition of legitimacy, state enforcement
or religious norms, or any combination of these--the likelihood
of acting through a political party is greatly increased.
</p><p align="justify">
An examination of Israeli politics since 1949 reveals that a
governing coalition is formed when major shares of two of the
three camps can be combined.  Until the 1977 elections,
coalitions usually comprised two-thirds of the labor camp plus
two-thirds of the religious camp plus a small crossover from the
civil camp.  In the Begin-led coalition, the same principle was
observed but in reverse.  Almost the entire civil camp, except
Independent Liberal Gideon Hausner, linked with the entire
religious camp.  This, more than any mathematical formula,
explains the basis of coalition formation in Israeli politics.
</p><p align="justify">

The shift toward greater concern for Jewish tradition as part of
Israel's civil religion by the pacesetters of Israeli society
reflects two factors: the perennial search for meaning
characteristic of Jews, including Israeli Jews, and the concern
for the Jewish future of Israel. These factors are mutually
reinforcing and are appropriate in a world where religious
concern is again on the rise.</p><p align="justify">


Four of the five forms of religious expression are represented in
the political process by parties, and the fifth
may have found a vehicle for gaining representation despite its
reluctance to do so.  Establishment religion has the National
Religious Party (Mafdal).  The popular religion of the Sephardic
majority found its expression in Tami in 1981 and among the Shas
voters in 1984. Ultra-Orthodox religion has its voice in Agudath
Israel, Degel HaTorah, and the Shas leadership.
</p><p align="justify">

Civil religion found its partisan in the Likud.  This, indeed,
was one of the contributions of Menachem Begin.  Using the
approach developed by his mentor, Ze'ev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky,
Begin cultivated the synthesis between nationalist politics and
Jewish religion, hence, his emphasis on Jewish ceremony and
observance as part of the public life of the state.  In this he
was ahead of his Herut party colleagues (except the Sephardim).
But he was very close to his constituency and found a common
language with his closest potential coalition partners.  No doubt
part of the reason that voters who previously supported Mafdal
voted for Likud in 1981 was that they felt Begin had a properly
positive attitude toward religion and religious tradition.</p><p align="justify">


Begin's constituency was undoubtedly drawn heavily from among
those deeply rooted in the popular religion, the Sephardic
<I>shomrei masoret</I> (observers of the tradition) and their Ashkenazic
counterparts.  Outsiders have asked how Begin--so much the
quintessential Polish Jew--managed to appeal to the Sephardim.
Much of the answer lay in this sharing of a common popular
religion to which he gave expression officially and privately.
For the Sephardim, he was an authentic Jew even if his customs
are different from theirs, unlike the Labor Party leaders who
impressed them as being not very "Jewish" at all, because they
seemed to have no links with religious tradition.
</p><p align="justify">
Only nonestablishment Judaism is unrepresented in the political
sphere, in great part because it is an expression of Western,
particularly American, ideas about the relationship between
religion and state and the need to maintain separation between
them.  Those views are reinforced by the interests of
nonestablishment Jews in Israel that require a separation between
establishment religion and politics if nonestablishment Judaism is
to gain the full recognition that it seeks.
</p><p align="justify">

Recently, a growing minority among the nonestablishment
leadership has begun to understand that the situation in Israel
is different from that in the United States and for
nonestablishment religion to get its share of the pie, it must
have representation in the political arena.  This minority has
worked in two directions.  Some, particularly in the Reform
movement, tried to form an alliance with the Labor Alignment
to get Labor to endorse the full recognition of their movements.
At one point in the 1981 campaign, this approach was gaining
ground.  Thinking it was really going to win an absolute majority
of seats in the Knesset, Labor was willing to take that position
even at the cost of alienating its former coalition partners from
the religious camp.  However, once it became apparent that Labor
would not win that majority and, indeed, was struggling for its
political life, its leaders backed away from that
position--unsuccessfully as it turned out, because they had
become identified by Orthodox and non-Orthodox alike as now
committed to an anti-Orthodox stance.  They have never repeated
that mistake; nor have they been able to secure needed Orthodox
support since.
</p><p align="justify">

Others have become involved in the parties of the sabra reform
movement, including the short-lived Democratic Movement for
Change and Shinui but particularly in the Citizens' Rights
Movement (CRM).  The CRM has offered these people hospitality but
it would be premature to suggest that it has become the political
expression of nonestablishment Judaism.  Nevertheless, more than
any other party, it has that potential.
</p><p align="justify">

The obverse of this is the spread of elements of religious
expression into the civil camp.  Picking up on Begin's model, the
Likud is increasingly committed to express some combination of
civil and popular religion.  Rather than following the
"modernization" model posited by many social scientists that as
its population becomes "modernized," Israeli politics will move
toward separation of church and state or at least greater
secularization, there is every sign that we are witnessing the
opposite.  As Israel becomes further removed from its founding
generation, its Jewish majority is even more concerned about the
state's Jewish authenticity and is looking for ways to link the
state to forms of Jewish religious expression that will reaffirm
and strengthen that authenticity.
</p><p align="justify">

The civil religion emerging in Israel is essentially
neo-Sadducean.  That is, the religious forms are designed to
bolster ties with the state and its institutions rather than
treating the state and its institutions as handmaidens of the
Jewish religious vision.  That is what separates the civil from
the religious camp when push comes to shove.  But, because a
majority of the religious camp places a high value on the state
and its institutions as instruments to achieve the religious
vision, in practice the difference often becomes irrelevant.
Menachem Begin was the fullest expression to date of using
neo-Sadduceanism as a bridging rather than a divisive force.  The
Labor leaders are also neo-Sadducees but their expression of that
tendency emphasizes its divisive side.  Which version of the
civil religion will win out remains to be seen, but the signs
point to a public desire for it to be bridging rather than
divisive.  It is unlikely that this sentiment will or can be
ignored by any major political party in Israel.
</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>Conclusion
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

So many pages after we have begun, we have ended by doing no more
than suggesting some of the ways in which Israel can be seen as a
Jewish state and the complexities involved in determining how
Israel is a Jewish state.  This writer hopes that the article has
avoided most of the polemic elements in that discussion, even
though the polemics are very much a part of what it means for
Israel to be a Jewish state.  Indeed, as long as the argument
continues as to what constitutes a Jewish state and how well
Israel meets the test, we know that the issue remains alive and a
real one.  
</p><p align="justify">

As long as so many of the Jews in Israel were born outside
of the country and were first Jews and only later Israelis,
Israel's true character as a Jewish state is rendered even harder
to delineate.  The real test will come in the future when the
vast majority of Israelis including the Israeli establishment
will have been born in Israel.  Israel achieved a native-born
majority in the 1980s but the mass aliya of Jews from the Soviet
Union is shifting things back again.  Thus it will be even longer
before Jews will have to confront that new reality.  If anything,
the aliya from the Soviet Union has reaffirmed the Jewishness of
the state, not only by giving the state a majority of Jews born
outside of it once again but by reaffirming the purposes for
which the state was established, purposes heartily endorsed by
Israelis of all backgrounds and birth places who, in being
reinvigorated as they have been by Israel's renewed role as a
place of refuge for Jews in need, have demonstrated once again
one dimension of Israel's role as a Jewish state.
</p><p align="justify">

How Israel will fall into the great tradition of Jewish
civilization and its political dimension in the future is an
unanswerable question.  It will be influenced not only by what
happens within Israel but how well Israel fits into a changing
world in which the old isolation or at least the old separations
between nations, groups and cultures are rendered increasingly
obsolete.  For those Israeli Jews who want Israel to be a Jewish
state qualitatively as well as quantitatively, it will be
necessary to learn new ways to achieve their goal.</p><BR>

7.<I> Edah</I> is often translated as congregation; that term has a
religious connotation today that it did not have when introduced
in sixteenth and seventeenth century biblical translations.  Then
it had a civil meaning as well.  It was a "congregation -- an
institutionalized gathering of people who congregate (come
together) that meets at regular times or frequently for common
action and decision-making.

25. When the camps crystallized in the Yishuv period, the General
Zionist parties with their liberal orientation were the dominant
non-religious opposition to Labor. This situation persisted
during the first generation of statehood.  Once the much weakened
General Zionists (by then known as the Liberal Party) joined with
Herut, first in Gahal and then in the Likud, and the latter
gained the upper hand, the name and character of the camp were
changed.  This occurred no later than the Knesset election of
1984.  The change reflects the camp's nationalistic and populist
character.</p><p align="justify">


26. It should be noted that the state school system, more or less
consolidated into two official Zionist trends in the 1950s,
has once again begun to divide along camp or movement lines.
Within the mamlakhti (state) system, there now are schools
"in the spirit of the Labor movement," "with supplementation
of Judaistic studies," and "experimental (open classroom)" as
well as the kibbutz schools which retained their own
curriculum all along. Within the mamlakhti-dati (state
religious) system there now are "Torani" schools.  Each
represents a new-style, intracamp ideological trend.
