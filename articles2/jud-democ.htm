<p align="justify">


 This is a crucial time for shaping Israel's democracy, just as it
 is for rebuilding Israel's economy.  The extreme right has
 precipitated a struggle over democracy while the left has embarked
 on a struggle over the place of Judaism in the state.  These
 extremists are distorting Jewish tradition to serve their own
 partisan goals.  The far right claims that Judaism is antithetical
 to democracy, so therefore proposes to jettison democratic
 institutions in the Jewish state.  Perversely, the far left agrees
 with the right's premise, and thus concludes that Israel should
 abandon Judaism.  There is great irony in this since in the
 Western world, especially the United States, it is accepted that
 the Bible and ancient Israel were sources of democracy, no less,
 if not more than the Greeks, and with good reason.  Part of this
 paradox can be resolved by a proper understanding of what
 constitutes democracy.
</p><BR>


                  <CENTER><H3> Two Dimensions of Democracy</H3></CENTER><p align="justify">



 In the recent debates in Israel, democracy seems to have been
 equated almost exclusively with pluralism and with its most
 individualistic variety at that.  That is only half the story.
 Democracy can be understood as having at least two dimensions: 1)
 self-government, that is to say, meaningful participation of
 individual citizens in the establishment of the polity in which
 they live and in its subsequent governance; 2) pluralism, that is
 to say, the right of every individual to develop for him or
 herself a way of life and a set of beliefs and opinions
 appropriate to it, consistent with agreed upon common norms, and
 to live accordingly, with minimum interference on the part of
 others, including and especially, on the part of government.</p><p align="justify">


 Both of these dimensions combine issues of liberty and equality,
 the twin pillars of democracy.  Neither self-government nor
 pluralism, nor for that matter, liberty and equality, are
 absolute.  Living in society requires the tempering of all in the
 face of the realities of the human condition but, for those who
 believe in them, they remain not only basic aspirations but basic
 requirements for the good society.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                       Judaism and Pluralism
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

 In some respects the relationship between Judaism and democracy is
 least strong in connection with pluralism.  Judaism is
 emphatically pluralistic when it comes to recognition of the
 separate identity of different nations.  The biblical vision,
 regularly reaffirmed in the Jewish political tradition, is that
 the nations and peoples of the world have a right to exist and be
 autonomous under God.  In this sense Judaism, unlike Christianity
 and Islam, is not ecumenical.  It does not seek a single world
 state, an ecumene, in which all national and religious differences
 are obliterated.  Quite to the contrary, the Jewish vision of the
 messianic world order is one in which all nations recognize the
 sovereignty of God but retain their separate national and perhaps
 even religious characteristics,if monotheistic.  This is a view
 reiterated by the prophets of ancient Israel, canonized in the
 Bible.  It is equally a tenet of modern Zionism, which offered a
 socialist or secularist variant for God's sovereignty, which while
 untraditional, follows the sense of the tradition in this
 respect.
</p><p align="justify">

 Judaism is not pluralistic when it comes to recognizing paganism
 among the nations -- it does not believe that anything and
 everything goes in such matters -- and classical Judaism does not
 accept a pluralism that rejects the Torah.  The question in both
 cases is one of interpretation.  Jewish monotheism is very strict
 indeed on the religious level.  Rejecting the one God is not
 acceptable human behavior.</p><p align="justify">


 In fact, Judaism recognizes that humans do have the freedom to
 choose, even in the matter of belief in one God, but are subject
 to God's response as He chooses if they choose incorrectly. At the
 same time Jews were not called upon by their religion to be God's
 policemen in this matter, except among themselves.  With regard to
 the nations, that was God's business.  This is a crucial
 distinction, one which Judaism is careful to draw. There are many
 things in this world which, according to Jewish tradition should
 be extirpated, but it is not our responsibility to do God's work
 in doing so.</p><p align="justify">


 On the other hand, a choice against God represented freedom to
 stay outside of the moral order, not to be democratically accepted
 as part of it.  Such freedom is like the freedom of states in
 international relations; it is anarchy, not order, while democracy
 implicitly and explicitly reflects the existence of order.</p><p align="justify">



 This short article cannot do justice to the problem of pluralism
 within Judaism. It is accepted that there is one Torah binding on
 all Jews, and a clear <I>halakhic</I> tradition growing out of the Torah.
 Still, at the very least, regional and local differences in
 customary observance are recognized as legitimate -- some even say
 binding.  Moreover, since the middle ages, it has been difficult
 to overrule local rabbinical courts on any <I>halakhic</I> matter.  In
 civil matters which are equally within the province of the Torah
 and its <I>halakhah</I> in traditional Judaism, there is even greater
 latitude.  Suffice it to say that Jewish tradition recognizes that
 within the four ells of Torah there is considerable room.
 Moreover, any honest look at Jewish constitutional history clearly
 reveals that the interpretation of Torah itself has changed
 greatly from epoch to epoch.  In other words, there have been a
 series of reconstitutions, the very fact of whose existence
 suggests the possibility of a real degree of pluralism in such
 matters.  My colleague, Professor Stuart Cohen, and I have traced
 these reconstitutions in considerable detail in our recent book,
<I> The Jewish Polity.</I></p><p align="justify">


 Contemporary Orthodoxy, with its effort to develop a monolithic
 approach to <I>halakhic</I> and religious matters, is just as erroneous
 as contemporary liberal Judaism which claims that there is no
 legitimate authority in Jewish life, that any Jew can do whatever
 he or she wants to in matters <I>halakhic</I> and religious.  In fact,
 even the most monistic Orthodox recognize a certain pluralism
 within <I>halakhah.</I>  That is why today we have a Chief Rabbinate, the
 Moetzet Gedolai Ha-Torah (Agudath Israel's Council of Torah
 Greats), the Moetzet Hakhmei HaTorah (the Sephardic Council of
 Torah Sages), and the various <I>batei din</I> (religious courts) of the
 extreme ultras. Whatever the fights among their members and
 partisans, the legitimacy of all is more or less mutually
 recognized.</p><p align="justify">


 In sum, Judaism accepts a degree of pluralism for Jews within the
 framework of Torah but not outside of it. With regard to democracy
 and pluralism, then, the relationship between Judaism and
 democracy is a qualified positive.</p><BR>


                    <H3><CENTER>Judaism and Self-Government</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


 When it comes to democracy as self-government, the relationship is
 very positive indeed.  The classic Jewish political tradition of
 the Bible makes it clear that sovereignty is God's but that
 day-to-day governance is in the hands of the people within the
 framework of the Divine constitution.  God and the people
 established an initial relationship through covenant, and God
 played the major role in setting forth the constitution,
 especially the religious and moral constitution of the people.</p><p align="justify">


 In political matters, the Torah makes it clear that there is no
 single preferred regime (not even the Davidic monarchy which later
 came to be preferred by many, especially after it no longer
 existed), and that it is up to the people to establish appropriate
 political systems which must meet the appropriate moral, social,
 and religious requirements. Thus an acceptable political system
 must be just and pursue justice; it must provide for the care of
 the less fortunate (the Biblical "widows and orphans"); and it
 must maintain the religious constitution of the Jewish people,
 however interpreted by the judges of the time.  It must also be
 republican, rooted in popular consent and involving the people in
 governance.</p><p align="justify">


 Let me reiterate: there is no doubt about the republican character
 of the classic Jewish polity, nor has there been throughout Jewish
 history.  The particular character of Jewish republicanism had a
 certain aristrocratic tinge because of the prominent role it gave
 to notables from leading families, and priests, prophets, and
 sages who had responsibilities for interpreting the Torah, all of
 whom had to share power in some way.  This led to the frequent
 appearance of oligarchic rule in the ancient Jewish polity and in
 diaspora Jewish communities, as degenerated forms of aristocratic
 republicanism, but in every case the regime remained republican.
 According to the Torah and <I>halakhically,</I> it must be constituted by
 all of the people, including women and children, and it may be
 changed by the people.  Whatever the problematics of counting
 women in a <I>minyan </I>for prayer, the Bible makes it clear that they
 were required to be present and counted at the great
 constitutional ceremonies establishing the <I>edah</I> (the Jewish
 polity) its covenants, and its subsidiary <I>kehillot.</I></p><p align="justify">


 In all of Jewish history, with the possible exception of small
 shuls here and there, there are no cases of autocracy, of one-man
 rule, certainly none beyond the arena of the local community. The
 one possible exception was Herod, who was imposed upon us by the
 Romans.  He was given power through nominally legitimate processes
 and then usurped that power to eliminate the other instruments
 which shared power with the king within the constitution.</p><p align="justify">


 This leads to the other dimension of Jewish republicanism, namely,
 that in the traditional constitution and throughout Jewish history
 power has always been divided among three domains, known in
 traditional Hebrew as <I>ketarim</I> (crowns): that of Torah, responsible
 for communicating God's word to the people and interpreting the
 Torah as constitution to them; Kehunah (priesthood), responsible
 for being a conduit from the people to God; and Malkhut, which may
 be best translated as civil rule, responsible for the day-to-day
 business of civil governance in the edah.  While there have been
 struggles for power among these <I>ketarim</I> and times in which one was
 stronger than the other, all three, and particularly Torah and
 Malkhut, have always been actively present in the governance of
 every Jewish polity from the local arena to the people as a whole.
 The relationship between Judaism and democracy has to be judged
 whole, not just in connection with specific religious laws, and it
 must be judged in light of this classical and continuing division
 of powers.</p><p align="justify">

 Thus when it comes to the popular constitution of the polity, the
 responsibility of the governors to govern, and a proper separation
 and distribution of powers among the governors -- the three great
 criteria for democracy -- Judaism passes every test.  The proof of
 the pudding is that in Western civilization the Bible is
 considered the foundation of democratic republicanism and has been
 so treated by democratic reformers throughout the history of the
 Western world.  The strong biblical base of American democracy,
 which grew out of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and which
 remains vital today is a case in point.  Our weakness has been in
 the inventing of appropriate institutions for the successful
 implementation of these principles.  Sometimes we did and
 sometimes we did not.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                  Democracy, Liberty and Equality
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

 This bring us back to questions of liberty and equality.  The
 Bible is a major source of teaching about liberty and equality for
 all of humanity; it should not be less than that for Jews.  The
 Bible emphasizes communal liberty and what the Puritans in the
 sixteenth century defined as federal liberty, that is to say, the
 liberty to live up to the terms of the covenant (federal, from the
 Latin <I>foedus</I> meaning covenant), rather than individual liberty.</p><p align="justify">


 Communal liberty stands in contrast to atomistic individualism as
 the highest good.  The Jews, like the Swiss, have emphasized
 individual liberty within the community, not apart from it.  This
 approach differs from the radical individualism espoused by many
 in the contemporary Western world.  Hence those espousing the
 latter will inevitably accuse Judaism of being undemocratic. Here
 we have a confrontation between different understandings of what
 constitutes liberty and, by extension, democracy.  Despite its
 claims, radical individualism is not the only starting point for
 defining democracy.
</p><p align="justify">

 We are helped in this by examining the concept of federal liberty.
 Federal liberty can be interpreted rather narrowly as some would
 have it or it can be interpreted more broadly.  It can be
 interpreted as having to do primarily with religious observance,
 as the Puritans did in the past and many of the ultra-Orthodox do
 today, or it may be interpreted as having to do with the
 maintenance of constitutional liberties, as the U.S. Supreme Court
 has interpreted it with regard to racial and gender
 discrimination.  In both cases, judges have relied upon the
 principle of federal liberty to modify what would otherwise be in
 their eyes, unbridled individualism.
</p><p align="justify">

 Federal liberty in this sense stands in contrast to natural
 liberty, that is to say, the right of every individual to do as he
 or she pleases, restrained only by nature.  The latter is only
 possible outside of society.  Otherwise it is both self and
 socially destructive to the highest degree.  Governments,
 including and especially democratic governments, are instituted to
 overcome the deficiencies of natural liberty which lead to anarchy
 and the war of all against all, whereby the strongest win at the
 expense of all others.  So, if the biblical teaching stands in
 opposition to unbridled individualism, that is a sign that it is
 among the best friends of true liberty which is based on
 restraining natural liberty through covenant.</p><p align="justify">

 So, too, with equality.  The biblical teaching is concerned with
 maximizing the basic equality of all members of the polity through
 sabbatical and jubilee legislation and other equalization
 measures.  On the other hand, Jewish tradition does not insist
 upon pure equality, only upon basic equality, understanding the
 difference.
</p><p align="justify">

 Were all this simply a matter of biblical teachings, we might say
 that Judaism has a classic tradition in harmony with democracy but
 that it has long since disappeared.  That is emphatically not the
 case. There is a Jewish political tradition which has persisted as
 an integral part of Jewish tradition in which all of these
 principles have found expression throughout Jewish history, while
 the Jews were in their land and in the diaspora, not without
 struggle and not perfectly by any means any more than can be said
 of any other people, but in real ways.  We at the Jerusalem Center
 for Public Affairs have been exploring that tradition since our
 founding and have compiled detailed evidence for its existence and
 influence, citing chapter and verse.  We have published the
 results of our investigations under the best academic auspices and
 in more general form, making them available to a variety of
 audiences.  Moreover, anticipating public concern with this issue
 by nearly a decade, we secured a commission from the Ministry of
 Education to prepare a course for high school students on the
 subject, emphasizing the importance of the Jewish political
 tradition in helping students to become better citizens of Israel.
 For us, the tradition offers standards of evaluation of Israel's
 political institutions and behavior in proper democratic fashion.
 That course is now being tested in the schools.</p><p align="justify">


 Both those on the right and those on the left who denigrate and
 deny the relationship between Judaism and democracy not only do
 both a great disservice but are simply wrong.  Each is trying to
 manipulate one or the other for their own ends.  Unlike them, I
 would submit that Israel would be well served to carefully
 consider the Jewish political tradition.  We can learn much from
 it in the matter of building a good polity and society.
