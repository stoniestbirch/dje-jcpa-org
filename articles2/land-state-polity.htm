There is little doubt that the Jewish people represents the
classic state-and-diaspora phenomenon of all time.  Indeed, it
seems that the term diaspora itself originated to describe the
Jewish condition.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">1</FONT></SUP>  In the 3500 or so years of the existence of
the Jewish people, Jewish states have existed for roughly 1000
years. Jewish diasporas have existed for at least 2600 years and,
if certain local traditions are accurate, perhaps even longer.
The diaspora has existed alongside a functioning Jewish state
and, for almost precisely 2000 years, without any state
recognized as politically independent.  Moreover, for 1500 years
the Jewish people existed without an effective political center
in their national territory, that is to say, as an exclusively
diaspora community, so much so that the institutions of the
Jewish community in Eretz Israel were themselves modeled after
those of the diaspora and the Jews functioned as a diaspora
community within their own land.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">2</FONT></SUP>  Nevertheless, the Jewish
people not only preserved their integrity as an ethno-religious
community, but continued to function as a polity throughout their
long history through the various conditions of state and
diaspora.</p><BR>

 
<H3><CENTER> Studying the Jewish People</CENTER></H3>
<p align="justify">

Most analyses of the Jewish people phenomena focus on the Jews as
a sociological category, whether they are considered an ethnic
group, a religious group, or both.  Jewish self-preservation
through religious and cultural differentiation and endogamy are
without doubt worthy of examination from a sociological
perspective.  For example, the way in which the Jews as a
diaspora community created a way of life of their own, involving
a calendar of daily specificity which established a separate
rhythm of Jewish life, setting them apart from their neighbors,
is worthy of the closest study.  In a parallel way, it is
possible to study the nature of Jewish exclusion from Christian
and Moslem societies through a combination of anti-Jewish
attitudes and measures on one hand, and the mutually acceptable
principle that the Jews were a nation in exile and hence
deserving of corporate autonomy, on the other. 
</p><p align="justify">
A focus on either of these, however, would be essentially
historical, since both have undergone great changes in the modern
epoch and to the extent that they survive at all, survive only as
remnants in the post-modern epoch.  Thus, while <I>halakhah</I> (Jewish
law) still specifies a completely separate rhythm of life for
Jews, no more than five percent of the Jews in the world today
live so fully in accordance to that rhythm that they separate
themselves from the society around them, and perhaps another 20
percent live sufficiently according to that rhythm to be
considered fully part of it.  Most other Jews are touched by that
rhythm to varying degrees depending on the extent of their
connection to Jewish life.  In every case it is a voluntary
matter since with the rise first of the modern nation-state, and
then of the State of Israel.  First the idea of the Jews as a
separate nation in exile was abandoned, first by the state
builders and then by most diaspora Jews as they accepted the
terms of emancipation.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">3</FONT></SUP>  Then the idea of the Jewish people being
bound by <I>halakhah</I> ceased to be accepted by a majority of the
Jews.  Similarly, the anti-Jewish attitudes of Christians and
Moslems which developed in an age when religion was at the center
of life, were transformed into modern anti-Semitism.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">4</FONT></SUP>  The latter
remains a factor in shaping the Jewish diaspora, certainly one
that is high in the consciousness of Jews everywhere.  It
substantially diminished as an active force in the aftermath of
the Holocaust and is only now beginning to reappear in certain
circles as a legitimate form of expression. 
</p><p align="justify">
It would be more useful to examine the respective roles of the
Jews in their own state and as an ethno-religious community
within the societies of which they are a part.  In most of those
societies they play the role of a catalytic minority, making a
contribution far in excess of their percentage of the total
population, in a variety of fields, especially those at the
cutting edge of social activity.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">5</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
One strong characteristic of the Jews as a group in their
relationship with the rest of the world is their strong tendency
to gravitate to the center of whatever universal communications
network exists at any particular time and place.  According to
the best opinion of the historians of the ancient world the first
Jews, symbolized by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were already
involved as nomads in the trading patterns of the Fertile
Crescent.  Their settlement in Canaan put them at the very center
of that network with its two anchors in Egypt and Mesopotamia.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">6</FONT></SUP>
Subsequent generations of Jews have continued that tradition.
Thus, unless prevented from doing so, Jews have always gravitated
to the capital cities of the world, and have been able to make
their influence, as individuals and as a group, felt
disproportionately.  Not only that, Jews have always been
involved in communications related enterprises: whether
communicating religious ideas, as in their earliest history --
ultimately to half of mankind -- or in radio, motion pictures,
and television in the twentieth century, communicating new
lifestyles worldwide. 
</p><p align="justify">
This phenomenon has left the Jews exposed as well as influential,
and Jews have paid the price for that exposure.  In other words,
Jews have played a very dangerous game as a small group of
extraordinary importance and centrality in world affairs.  As
such, they have generated both strong positive and negative
images and expectations, which have led to periodic efforts to
cultivate them and equally frequent attacks upon them --
outbreaks of persecution which often have culminated in expulsion
and at times, in massacre and Holocaust. 
</p><p align="justify">
As a result of these pushes and pulls, the Jewish people is
different from other peoples because it has been a people in
constant movement. Even as they also have longed for their land.
The conventional view of Jewish history is that of shifting
centers of Jewish life, so that the Jews themselves have the
self-image of a people of the move, for better or for worse.
These constant migrations were, on the one hand, disrupting, but
on the other, they offered the Jews as a group opportunities to
renew life and to adapt to new conditions.  In other words, they
served the same purpose as Frederick Jackson Turner and his
school have suggested that the land frontier served in the
history of the United States -- enabling life to repeatedly begin
anew, willy-nilly if not by choice (and it was a mixture of both,
since Jews often chose to migrate to new areas and were not
simply forced to do so), which offered new opportunities for
adaptation and change.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">7</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
At the same time, the constant migrations generated a religious
culture based upon time rather than space, upon the shared
expressions of a common temporal rhythm rather than rootedness in
a common land.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">8</FONT></SUP>  Every civilization must somehow combine the
spatial and the temporal -- it must be located geohistorically.
Particularly in pre-modern times, most emphasized the spatial
over the temporal, existing and functioning because of
deep-rootedness in a particular land and relatively unaware of the
changes wrought by time.  The accelerated pace of change since
the opening of the modern epoch, and even somewhat before, has
made people aware of time and its passage in ways that were not
true earlier.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">9</FONT></SUP>  For most, however, the emphasis on space over
time has remained, strengthened the rise of the modern state with
its emphasis on territoriality and sovereignty within particular
territories as the guiding principle in the organization of
civilization. 
</p><p align="justify">
The Jews remained the anomaly in all this.  Not having a
functioning territorial state of their own and not even being
concentrated in a particular territory, the Jews emphasized the
temporal and organized time in the service of Jewish survival and
self-expression.  <I>Halakhah</I> (literally, the way) emphasizes the
organization of time, the rhythm of its passage and the
obligations of Jews to sanctify those rhythms -- in daily prayers
and study, the weekly Sabbath, and through holy days, festivals,
and celebrations at representative seasons. 
</p><p align="justify">
On the other hand, the Jews were not unconcerned about space
-- that would have made them unidimensional.  The Land of Israel
always remained a vitally important space for them, one to which
they expected to be restored at the right time and in which they
sought to maintain organized Jewish life at all times, through
regular reinforcements from the diaspora even in the worst
times.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">10</FONT></SUP>  Ultimately, modern Jews took matters into their own
hands rather than wait for the restoration only in messianic
times.  Through the Zionist movement they reestablished first an
autonomous Jewish community and then a Jewish state in the
land.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">11</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Despite the success of Zionism, three-quarters of world Jewry,
remain outside of the State of Israel.  They are devoted to it,
but do not seek to make it the state of their citizenship or
residence.  So, just as moderns transformed the pre-modern
commitment to space over time into a more modern commitment
through the modern state system so did modern Jews or, more
accurately, post-modern Jews transform the particular Jewish
relationship between time and space formed in pre-modern times
into a more contemporary expression of same. 
</p><p align="justify">
The new relationship is at the heart of the new forms of diaspora
Jewish political expression that have emerged in our time.
Working on behalf of Israel has become a principal expression of
Jewishness in the post-modern epoch whose secular character has
served to further diminish the religious dimension of Jewish
identification.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">12</FONT></SUP>  The existence of Israel has stimulated a sense
of political efficacy among diaspora Jews as well as those in the
Jewish state, which not only manifests itself in Jewish lobbies
for Israel, but also in Jewish political self-assertion in other
matters which Jews perceive as affecting the Jewish people as a
group. 
</p><p align="justify">
The definition of what Jews see as affecting them as a group can
also has changed in the twentieth century.  In the latter half of
the modern epoch, Jewish self-interest came to be considered
almost totally coincident with liberalism and even
left-liberalism, since the liberals and the left were the
principal advocates of Jewish emancipation while the
conservatives and the right, in their support for the ancien
regime, implicitly if not explicitly denied Jews full entry into
the larger society.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">13</FONT></SUP>  Certainly by the latter half of the
nineteenth century the vast majority of all Jews, traditional or
modern, accepted the liberal outlook if only because they had no
other choice.  This convergence of interest was so great that
Jews came to believe that it had always been so whereas, in fact,
in pre-modern times the interests of diaspora Jews converged at
least as frequently -- and usually more -- with the conservatives
and guardians of the status quo as with those seeking change,
often at Jewish expense. 
</p><p align="justify">
This overwhelming Jewish identification with liberalism had a
latent functional utility in providing a unifying ideology for
Jews at a time when traditional Jewish society was breaking down
and the Jews were losing the traditional bonds which had united
them.  The reestablishment of the Jewish state and the shifting
goals of left-liberalism have led to the gradual breakdown of
that automatic convergence, at the same time that the Jews found
another rallying point around which to coalesce.  Today,
faithfulness to liberalism is no longer a requisite for the
maintenance of common Jewish ties in the diaspora.  Israel now
serves that purpose, even for those who may be critical of the
policies of a particular Israeli government. 
</p><BR>
<H3><CENTER>

              Viewing the Jewish People as a Polity 
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
The suggestion that it is possible to talk about a world
Jewish polity is based upon a combination of factors.  In part,
it rests upon the persistence of the sense of common fate among
Jews all over the world, the sense of which was reactivated as a
result of the events of this century.  This sense has led to
concrete efforts to work together to influence the shape of that
fate wherever Jews have settled, particularly whenever they have
required the assistance of their brethren.  This, in turn, has
led to the development of institutionalized frameworks for
cooperation in a variety of contexts, in our times increasingly
revolving around the State of Israel for self-evident reasons. 
</p><p align="justify">
Finally, the entire effort has acquired a certain legitimacy
in the eyes of Jews and the non-Jewish world alike as a result of
the emerging redefinition of what constitutes the proper context
for political linkage and action, namely, the recognition -- in
the Western world, at least -- that there are other forms of
political relationship than those embraced within the
nation-state, that polity is a far more complex condition than
statehood, and that it can involve multiple relationships, not
all of which are territorially based.  In many respects, this
represents a rediscovery of what had been an accepted phenomenon
in the Western world until the modern era. 
</p><p align="justify">
In short, we are beginning to recognize that all polities are
not states.  The Greeks, as usual, had a word for it.  The
Hellenistic world coined the term <I>politeuma</I> to describe phenomena
such as the worldwide Jewish polity of that age in which Jews
simultaneously maintained strong political links, including
citizenship, with their respective territorial polities, the
Hellenistic cities, and with one another across lands and seas. 
</p><BR>
<H3><CENTER>

                      An Historical Survey 
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
According to the Bible, the first Jew was Abraham, son of Terah,
who was born in Ur of the Chaldeans, located in southern
Mesopotamia near the Persian Gulf, who migrated with his family
to Haran, now in northern Syria.  On God's instructions, Abraham
migrated to the land of Canaan (now Israel) which he subsequently
left briefly because of a famine, but to which he soon returned. 
</p><p align="justify">
Of Abraham's immediate descendants, only his son Isaac never
left Canaan.  His grandson Jacob, renamed Israel after wrestling
with God, sojourned for 20 years in Aram (now Syria) as a young
man, returned to the land, and then spent his final days in
Egypt.  Abraham's great-grandson, Joseph, was forcibly taken to
Egypt but remained there, later bringing his whole family to join
him there.  While in Egypt, the children of Israel expanded from
an extended family into a league of tribes while in Egypt. 
</p><p align="justify">
The B'nai Israel (Children of Israel or Jacob) left Egypt as a
people in a dramatic exodus led by a charismatic figure, Moses.
In the course of the immediate exodus, Moses, as God's spokesman,
established the basis for citizenship, promulgated a common law
for the tribes immediately following the passage through the
waters, and organized a full-blown polity at the foot of Sinai
within seven weeks, through a national covenant and the
introduction of a more regularized judicial structure and
political organization.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">14</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Whether the traditional account is historically accurate or not
is far less important than what that account teaches us about the
origins of the Jewish people and how it has shaped the Jews'
self-perception over at least three and perhaps closer to four
millennia.  What it suggests is that the people's political,
social, and religious institutions were, from the first,
organized so that they were portable and, however desirable it
might be to do so, did not need to be attached to the national
soil in order to function. 
</p><p align="justify">
No doubt as a consequence of these experiences, the basic form of
Jewish organization was designed to accommodate migration as well
as concentration in a national state.  Since the beginning of
political science, all political theory has converged on one or
another of three basic forms of political founding, organization,
and development: hierarchical, organic, and covenantal.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">15</FONT></SUP>
Hierarchical forms, which usually are the result of some initial
conquest leading to the establishment of a political order,
require a high concentration of power within a power pyramid, a
more or less orderly structure, with a clear chain of command.
Hierarchical forms are particularly useful for the governance of
peoples concentrated within a single structure and clearly
subject to the authority of those who dominate that structure.
This kind of government went against the grain of Jewish
political culture from earliest times, even when the Jews were
concentrated in one land.  Once they were scattered and without
any state, this form of political organization was utterly
impractical. 
</p><p align="justify">
The organic form presumes a gradual and continuous development of
political institutions serving a population rooted in one place,
into a political system which can continue to function as long as
the population is so rooted, but which once detached no longer
has the wherewithal to survive.  Obviously for the Jews this was
equally impractical. 
</p><p align="justify">
The covenantal form of political organization emerges out of
agreements among equals, or at least equals for the purposes of
the agreement, to form partnerships for purposes of political
organization.  It does not necessarily presuppose a territory,
(although the people in its territory is the preferred condition),
a clear chain of command, or organic development in a particular
place.  On the contrary, it is flexible in form, it can be
territorial or transterritorial as the case may be, and it is
capable of binding people who cannot be bound by force or by
custom because they are not bound to a particular territory. 
</p><p align="justify">
The Jewish people opted for the covenantal form no later than
the exodus from Egypt and so organized themselves during their
formative generation in the desert.  Granted, the tribes
themselves had an organic dimension in the sense that the members
of each claimed to be descended from a common ancestor.  In that
sense, the Jewish people has always tried to combine kinship and
consent, the organic with the covenantal dimension, to secure its
unity.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">16</FONT></SUP>  As a result, the Jews have been able to function as an
ethnic group based upon primordial ties of kinship, a religious
group based upon acceptance of the responsibilities of the Jewish
religion, and a polity which rests upon the combination of both
kinship and consent. 
</p><p align="justify">
Over the centuries the Jews have fine-tuned this form of
polity building.  After the founding covenant at Sinai, the
Israelite tribes renewed that covenant in the plains of Moab just
before entering the land and then renewed it again at Shechem
under Joshua at the time of the conquest of Canaan.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">17</FONT></SUP>  When
Israel changed its regime to add a king to the tribal federation,
the first strictly national-political covenant was made between
the tribes and David.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">18</FONT></SUP>  Much later, after David's kingdom had
been divided and the northern kingdom conquered by Assyria, the
regime was reconstituted under King Hezekiah through another
covenant.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">19</FONT></SUP> When the exiles returned from Babylonia after the
first diaspora, they covenanted once again to reestablish the
state of Judea within the framework of the Persian Empire.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">20</FONT></SUP>
Finally, in the last reconstitution of the Jewish polity within
the Land of Israel until our own times, Simon the Hasmonean
reconstituted an independent Jewish state through a covenant with
the representatives of the people and the other institutions of
the community.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">21</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Subsequent to the exile, when it was no longer possible to
use covenants for state building, they were transformed into
instruments for community building with any ten men able to
constitute themselves as a community and as a court of law within
the context of the Torah through an appropriate covenant.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">22</FONT></SUP>
Finally, in our own times the reestablishment of the State of
Israel rested on a series of covenants, culminating in the
Declaration of Independence, referred to in Hebrew as the "Scroll
of Independence," which was accepted, witnessed, and signed by a
wall-to-wall coalition of the Jewish community in Eretz Israel at
the time.  It not only fits the classic covenantal model but has
become by decision of the Supreme Court of Israel at least a
quasi-constitutional document, and is so treated by the courts.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">23</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Beyond the sheer fact of communal survival, consent has
remained the essential basis for the shaping of the Jewish
polity.  Jews in different localities consented (and consent)
together to form congregations and communities -- the terms are
often used synonymously.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">24</FONT></SUP>  They did (and do) this formally
through articles of agreement, charters, covenants, and
constitutions.  The traditional Sephardi term for such articles
of congregational-communal agreement, <I>askamot</I> (which mean,
articles of agreement), conveys this meaning exactly.  The local
communities were (and are) then tied together by further
consensual arrangements, ranging from formal federations to the
tacit recognition of a particular <i>halakhic</i> authority, shtadlan,
(intervenor before the foreign suzerain on behalf of the Jewish
community), or supralocal body as authoritative.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">25</FONT></SUP>  When
conditions were propitious, the de facto confederation of Jewish
communities extended to wherever Jews lived.  When this level of
political existence was impossible, the binding  force of Jewish
law served to keep the federal bonds from being severed. 
</p><p align="justify">
Thus, over the course of many centuries a very distinctive
kind of polity has developed as the organized expression of
Jewish communal life.  While it has undergone many permutations
and adaptations, a thread of institutional and ideational
continuity has run through the entire course of Jewish political
life to give the Jewish people meaningful continuity. 
</p><p align="justify">
It is important to emphasize this covenantal device, because
of the way in which it made possible organized Jewish life in the
diaspora beyond the merely religious sphere.  Covenanting was
only one of a range of complementary devices developed by the
Jewish people to maintain their collective integrity even in the
diaspora, with or without a center in the Land of Israel.  In
pre-modern times, when the Jewish community was all-embracing,
whether in the state or the diaspora, these devices formed a
framework within which all or virtually all Jews functioned.
After the autonomous Jewish community had given way to the
integration of individual Jews into the states in which they
lived, this framework had to be readapted to a voluntaristic
situation in which it provided a core, or magnet, around which
those Jews who wished to, could coalesce rather than a framework
embracing Jews whether they wanted to or not.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">26</FONT></SUP>  But the basic
instrumentalities have survived the transition and continue to
offer the opportunity to do so under these new circumstances. 
</p><p align="justify">
In sum, the Jewish people has the distinction of being the
longest-lasting and most widespread "organization" in the history
of the world.  Its closest rival to that title is the Catholic
Church.  Curiously -- and perhaps significantly -- the two are
organized on radically opposed principles.  The Catholic Church
is built on hierarchical principles from first to last and gains
its survival power by their careful and intelligent
manipulation.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">27</FONT></SUP>  The Jewish people is organized on covenantal or
federal (from the Latin foedus = covenant), principles from first
to last and enhances its survival power by applying them almost
instinctively in changing situations.  The contrasting
characteristics of these two modes or organization are
intrinsically worthy of political and social investigation.  So,
too, is the role of the Jewish polity in the development and
extension of federal principles, institutions, and processes.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">28</FONT></SUP>

              From Territorial Rootedness to Diaspora 
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
Sometime in the thirteenth century BCE the Israelite tribes
crossed the Jordan into Canaan and began a period of
concentration in what was renamed Eretz Israel.  For seven and a
half centuries the Jews remained concentrated in their land under
independent governments of their own.  This is the classic period
of Jewish history as described in the Bible.  During that period
there may have been temporary settlements of Jews outside of the
country and there are traditions of permanent Jewish settlements
in such places as Yemen, although there is no corroborative
evidence. But, in fact, at least 99 percent of the Jewish people
were located in the Land of Israel. 
</p><p align="justify">
In 721-22 BCE, Israel, the northern kingdom, comprising 10 of
the 12 original tribes, was conquered by Assyria and a major if
undetermined portion of its population deported to other parts of
the Assyrian Empire, apparently in northern Mesopotamia.  Popular
legend has it that these exiles disappeared by assimilating into
the local populations but there are traditions among the Jews of
northern Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan that they are descended from
those exiles.  Some historians hypothesize that at least a
segment later merged with the subsequent exiles of the Jews from
Judea who were exiled from their country after the conquest of
the southern kingdom by the neo-Babylonians in the first decades
of the sixth century BCE.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">29</FONT></SUP>  Those who remained in the land were
incorporated within the Kingdom of Judah.  Thus what changed was
the tribal system, which disappeared as such. 
</p><p align="justify">
Whether Assyrian deportation was the first diaspora or not,
it is clear that the recognized Jewish diaspora begins with the
Babylonian captivity. It was then that organized communities of
Jewish exiles were established in Babylonia and Egypt.  They
quickly developed institutions to accommodate their corporate
needs in the diaspora, including the beit knesset which has come
to be known to us in its Greek translation as the synagogue and
which, in fact, means house of assembly, a kind of town hall,
where Jews could undertake all their public functions especially
governance, study and worship.  Indeed the Hebrew term <I>knesset</I>
(assembly) is from the Aramaic <I>kanishta</I> which is a translation of
edah, the original Hebrew term describing the Jewish polity, the
assembly or congregation of the entire people.  Thus, the beit
knesset was a miniature version of that assembly -- one which
could be established anywhere.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">30</FONT></SUP>  Thus, the basic framework
established over 2500 years ago has remained at least part of
the basic framework for diaspora Jewish organization ever since. 
</p><p align="justify">
It should be noted that the beit knesset is a product of the
Babylonian exile; Jews who left Eretz Israel for Egypt fried to
develop another framework around a temple constructed as a
surrogate for that in Jerusalem, a system which required
territorial permanence.  That system did not gain acceptance
outside of Egypt.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">31</FONT></SUP>  Even there it was replaced by the Babylonian
system some 400 years later, precisely because of the portability
of the beit knesset and the possibility of establishing
synagogues wherever ten Jewish men gathered. 
</p><p align="justify">
Seventy years after the destruction of Jerusalem in 537 BCE,
Cyrus the Great conquered the neo-Babylonian Empire and,
following his policy of the conciliation of minority peoples
through granting cultural autonomy, allowed the Jews to return to
Judea to rebuild their Temple.  In fact, only a relatively small
number of Jews chose to do so.  While they and subsequent
migrations, culminating in the great reconstitution of Ezra and
Nehemiah approximately a century later, did succeed in
reestablishing Eretz Israel as the center of Jewish life, a large
diaspora community remained in Babylonia and, indeed, under
Persian rule, spread throughout the Persian Empire.  It was
paralleled by a somewhat smaller but still significant diaspora
in Egypt which spread into other parts of northern Africa,
Cyprus, and Asia Minor. 
</p><p align="justify">
For the next millennium the Jewish people were organized in a
point-counterpoint arrangement.  The Jewish concentration in
their land claimed and usually exercised hegemony within the
Jewish polity, but with a substantial population, perhaps
consistently a majority, scattered in diaspora communities
throughout the civilized world of that time.  Until its
destruction in 70 CE, the Temple of Jerusalem served as the focal
point for both, with the Temple tax uniting Jews in the land and
outside of it. 
</p><p align="justify">
The principal institutions of the edah -- the Jewish people as a
whole -- were located on the Temple Mount.  New institutional
arrangements were developed to provide representation for
diaspora Jewry in those institutions, the first of which was
known as the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah (men of the great assembly)
which later gave way to a successor institution, the Sanhedrin,
which is a corruption of the Hebrew corruption of the Greek term
for assembly.  But given the problems of transportation and
communication in that period, there were difficulties in
providing diaspora Jews continuous access and representation in
those common institutions.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">32</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
In the diaspora itself two patterns developed, each a response to
the particular host civilization in which Jews found themselves.
In most of western Asia, where the Persians and their successors
ruled, the Jews tended to be concentrated in particular areas and
could organize their public life on a quasi-territorial basis,
with regional as well as local institutions.  Out of this evolved
the "Babylonian" Jewish community which was concentrated in what
is today the heartland of Mesopotamia.  By the second century CE
it had an extensive political structure headed by a Resh Galuta
(exilarch) whose powers were those of a protected king -- for
Jews a constitutional monarch who was recognized as being a
descendant of the House of David.  The Resh Galuta shared his
powers with two great <I>yeshivot</I> (another Hebrew term for assembly)
who had custody of the teaching and interpretation of the Torah.
Together these institutions governed the collectivity of local
Jewish communities within the empire.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">33</FONT></SUP>  This framework persisted
until the eleventh century, even after the seventh century Arab
conquest which transformed the language, culture, and religion of
western Asia. Until the fifth century CE, it was at least
formally subordinate to the equivalent polity in Eretz Israel
which had a similar structure, headed by a <I>nassi</I> (patriarch),
also recognized as being of the House of David, balanced by the
Sanhedrin.  After the Roman suzerain abolished the patriarchate
in the fifth century, the Resh Galuta and the yeshivot extended
their control over virtually the entire Jewish world. 
</p><p align="justify">
This was facilitated by the Arab conquests of the seventh and
eighth centuries that brought over 95 percent of all Jews under
the rule of the Muslim caliphate, which empowered the Resh Galuta
and the yeshivot to represent the Jewish community as their
predecessors had.  It was only with the breakup of the original
Muslim empire and the development of independent successor
states, that the Jews lost this common well-nigh worldwide
diaspora structure.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">34</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Meanwhile, in the Mediterranean world, where Hellenistic
civilization held sway and first the Greek and then the Roman
empires provided a common political structure, the Jews were
concentrated in cities.  (The exception here was Egypt which also
had a wider territorial concentration for several centuries.)
There they formed a part of the polis organization developed for
each city as part of its Hellenization after the Alexandrian
conquests of the fourth century BCE. 
</p><p align="justify">
It was in those cities that Jews formed autonomous communities
within each polis for which the Greek term politeuma was
invented.  Each of the politeumata represented a separate
structure with connections to Jerusalem but with no formal
linkages between one another.  Thus the Jewish communities in the
Hellenistic and Roman worlds were far more fragmented.  The
institutions within each politeuma were based on Jewish models
influenced by Greek practices and often bearing Greek names, but
each was autonomous even when the Jews had citizenship within the
<I>polis</I> itself.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">35  </FONT></SUP>Most of these <I>politeumata</I> were destroyed during
the uprising of the Hellenistic diaspora against the Romans in
the years 115-117 CE.  The communities reconstituted subsequent
to that event had more limited rights.  It was only after the
Arab conquest that regional organizations of communities were
established in those countries linked to the Resh Galuta and
yeshivot in Babylonia which was also the seat of the caliphate or
to the yeshiva in Eretz Israel that, while nominally subordinate
to the former, claimed and was granted special status because it
was located in the land. 
 </p><p align="justify">
Both forms of diaspora organization were linked to Jerusalem when
an independent Jewish state was reborn in the middle of the
second century BCE.  That state survived for less than a century,
then went through a period of upheavals for the next 200 years
until the failure of the Bar Kokhba rebellion (132-135 CE) led
the Jews to abandon major efforts to rebel against Rome and
rather reconstitute themselves along the model of the diaspora
communities within their own land.  The nesiut (patriarchate) and
Sanhedrin which formed the new structure of the community of
Eretz Israel also functioned as <I>prima inter parus</I> in the
governance and religious leadership of the Jewish people, until
those institutions were abolished in the middle of the fifth
century, after which Jewish communal organization in Eretz Israel
became even more diaspora-like in character, undergoing changes
under different rulers from then until the reestablishment of the
Jewish state in 1948, some 1500 years later.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">36</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Thus the diaspora became the moving force in Jewish life. For 600
years the Babylonian center predominated.  In the eleventh
century there was increased Jewish migration to both southern and
northern Europe which led to the transfer of power to the Jewish
centers in Spain and to a lesser extent, northern France and the
Rhineland.  The Iberian Peninsula and west central Europe
remained the centers of Jewish life until the fifteenth century
when expulsions on the one hand and attractive offers of refuge
on the other led the Jews from both centers to move back
eastward: Iberian Jewry to form new concentrations in the Ottoman
Empire, particularly in the Balkans, and Central European Jewry
to concentrate in Poland.  These two regions remained the
principal centers of Jewish life until the nineteenth century.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">37</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
At first, Spanish Jewry -- the Sephardim -- under Moslem rule
followed the Babylonian pattern of regional organization, with
local communities subordinate to the regional leadership.  Once
they came under Christian rule, the local communities rose to
predominance and regional organization was limited to confederal
arrangements. That pattern was later preserved in the Ottoman
Empire where every congregation was autonomous and even within
the same city congregations were often no more than confederated.
The Jews of west central Europe -- the Ashkenazim -- developed
local autonomy from the first, with loose leagues or
confederations of communities providing whatever unification
there was.  But once they moved eastward to Poland they formed
regional structures culminating in the Vaad Arba Aratzot (Council
of the Four Lands), a fully-articulated federation of the Jewish
communities of Poland, and its parallels in Lithuania, Bohemia,
and Moravia. 
</p><p align="justify">
Worldwide, the Jewish people lost any common political structure
after the middle of the eleventh century but remained tied
together by a common constitutional-legal system (the <i>halakhah</i>),
which was kept dynamic by a system of rabbinic decision-making
which was communicated to Jews wherever they happened to be
through an elaborate network of responsa -- formal written
questions posed to leading Jewish legal authorities which
produced formal written responses that came to form a body of
case law.  This was possible because 1500 years earlier, at the
time of Ezra and Nehemiah, the Jews had developed a legal system
parallel to their political structure which translated the
original constitutional materials of the Torah into an elaborate
structure designed to enable every Jews to conduct his entire
life within the framework of Jewish law, no matter where he
happened to reside.<FONT SIZE="-1">38</FONT> 
</p><p align="justify">
The legal system that emerged became what was, in effect, a
portable state.  The <i>halakhah</i>'s avowed purpose was to transform
each individual Jew into a person concerned with holiness. Hence,
it was not designed with a political purpose in the usual sense,
but this very concern for individual and collective holiness in a
larger sense became a political end which served to provide a
basis for the unity of Jewry, under a system of civil and
criminal as well as religious law, even in exile, as long as
there was a general commitment to this end or at the very least
to living under Jewish law as distinct from any other law. 
</p><p align="justify">
While it is clear that not every Jew had the same commitment
to holiness as an ultimate end, or to the particular path to
holiness developed by the <i>halakhah</i>, in the centuries immediately
following the destruction of the Temple this legal system gained
normative status among Jews so that even those who were not
highly motivated by its ultimate goals but who wanted to stay
within the framework of the Jewish community felt the necessity
to conform.  Because of its attention to minute detail, every
aspect of life, public and private, civil and criminal, religious
and "secular" (a category which did not exist within the Jewish
vocabulary) the <i>halakhah</i> was able to become all-embracing.  The
political structures developed by the Jews to conduct their
public affairs were authorized by the <i>halakhah</i> and rooted in it,
and a major task of Jewish communities was to enforce <i>halakhic</i>
regulations. 
</p><p align="justify">
The opening of the modern epoch in the middle of the seventeenth
century slowly eroded this comprehensive framework, in waves
rolling from west to east.  Jewish autonomy was the first
casualty in Western Europe as the new nation-states dismantled
medieval corporatism, a system which had protected Jewish
communal separatism.  At first, Jews became people without civic
status in the new states and without the possibility of
maintaining their own states within the state.  This led them to
demand emancipation and citizenship as individuals, which they
ultimately gained after a struggle sometimes taking two
centuries.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">39</FONT></SUP>  Finally, in the nineteenth century, the elimination
of Jewish autonomy and then emancipation moved eastward to engulf
the major concentrations of Jews in Eastern Europe and the
eastern Mediterranean, although it was not until the twentieth
century that emancipation was completed in either region.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">40</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
While these changes were taking shape, a two-pronged demographic
shift of great importance began.  In the first place, the live
birth and survival rate among Jews rose rapidly, causing the
number of Jews in the world to soar.  In the second, the Jews
began to migrate at an accelerating pace to the lands on the
Western world's great frontier: the Western hemisphere, southern
Africa, and Australia in particular, but also in far smaller
numbers to East Asia, thus initiating a shift in the balance of
Jewish settlement in the world (see Table 1).<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">41</FONT></SUP>

Medieval corporatism never gained a foothold in the New World and
the Jews who migrated to those lands entered their host societies
as individuals.  Hence all Jewish life was voluntary in character
from the first.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">42</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
While the majority of Jews readily abandoned communal separatism
for the advantages of modern society, only a minority were ready
to fully give up their Jewish ties in return.  Most wanted to
find some way to remain within the Jewish fold even while
participating as individuals in the civil societies in which they
found themselves or to which they migrated.  Hence they were
faced with the task of adapting Jewish institutions to a new kind
of diaspora existence. 
</p><p align="justify">
Once again the great flexibility of covenantal institutions
proved itself.  The Jews transformed their <I>kehillot</I> (communities)
into voluntary structures.  In the Western world, where pluralism
was tolerated principally in the religious sphere, the Jews
transformed the beit knesset into the synagogue as we know it,
whose manifest purposes were avowedly religious and whose central
functions revolved around public worship, but which was able to
embrace within it the various ethnic social, educational, and
welfare functions which the Jewish community sought to preserve,
principally on a supplementary basis. 
</p><p align="justify">
In Eastern Europe, where modernization frequently meant
secularization, new forms of Jewish association developed,
principally cultural and political, utilizing similar principles
and, with the exception of the public worship dimension which was
absent from them, were devoted to the same ethnic social,
educational, and welfare purposes, only on a more extensive basis
because Jews remained nationally separate in that part of the
world.  By and large, Jews in the Arab world followed the Western
pattern when they began to modernize, but within a framework in
which their separate ethnic identity was clearly recognized by
one and all, and in which they preserved a certain legal
authority over the community members by virtue of their continued
control of personal status laws involving marriage, divorce, and
inheritance which remained customary in the Islamic world.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">43</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Nevertheless, the new voluntarism did make it very difficult,
if not impossible, to provide a comprehensive framework for the
maintenance of Jewish culture and civilization.  It rapidly
became clear that the open society would lead to the assimilation
of many of the most talented members of the Jewish community who
saw greater opportunities outside of the Jewish fold.  It was in
response to this as well as to anti-Semitism that the Jewish
national movement developed, which made as its goal the
restoration of Jewish statehood in Eretz Israel.  This movement,
known as Zionism, was initially organized on the same covenantal
principles as every other such Jewish endeavor, developing first
through local societies and then, in a massive leap forward
represented by the First Zionist Congress in 1897, through the
World Zionist Organization established at that congress.  In 50
years the WZO succeeded in bringing about the establishment of a
Jewish state.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">44</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
Zionism from the first embodied two conflicting goals.  There
were those who were Zionists because, while they wanted the
Jewish people to survive, they wanted them to become normalized
like other nations.  They believed that if the Jewish people or
some substantial segment of them were to return to their own
land, they could live like the French, the Italians, the Czechs,
the Poles, or whatever.  The other trend in the Zionist movement
was to see Zionism as a means of restoring the vitality of Jewish
civilization, which would retain its uniqueness but be better
able to survive under modern conditions by being rooted in a land
and state where the Jews formed a majority. 
</p><p align="justify">
The first approach more or less negated the continued existence
of a diaspora once a Jewish state was established. According to
it, those Jews who wanted to remain Jews would settle in the
state where they would live increasingly normalized lives,
interacting with the rest of the world as nationals of any state
interact with nationals of any other.  The rest of the Jews would
assimilate as individuals into their countries of residence, no
longer needing to preserve their Jewishness.  Many of those who
embraced the second view also wished to negate the diaspora in
the sense that they wanted all Jews to settle in Israel.  But
they did not see diaspora existence as impossible per se. Rather,
the Jewish state could become the focal point of the renewed
Jewish people, whether living in the state or in the diaspora.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">45 </FONT></SUP>
</p><p align="justify">
Reality forced the issue.  The state was established.  Even after
an initial mass migration of Jews from Europe, North Africa, and
Western Asia, only about 20 percent of the Jewish people were
concentrated within it (the figure is now 25 percent).  Moreover,
despite assimilatory tendencies, the great bulk of the Jews
outside the state showed every inclination of wanting to remain
Jews.  Consequently, a new interplay between state and diaspora
began to emerge.  In this, the second generation since the
establishment of the state, it is still evolving.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">46</FONT></SUP>

                   The Contemporary Situation 
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
The Second World War marked the culmination of all the trends and
tendencies of the modern epoch and the end of the epoch itself
for all mankind.  (The dates 1946-49 encompass the benchmarks of
the transition from the modern to the post-modern epochs.)  For
the Jewish people, the Holocaust and the establishment of the
State of Israel provided the pair of decisive events that marked
the crossing of the watershed into the post-modern world.  In the
process, the locus of Jewish life shifted and virtually every
organized Jewish community was reconstituted in some way. 
</p><p align="justify">
Central to the reconstitution was the reestablishment of a Jewish
commonwealth in Israel.  The restoration of a politically
independent Jewish state created a new focus of Jewish energy and
concern precisely at the moment when the older foci had reached
the end of their ability to attract a majority of Jews.  As the
1967 and subsequent crises demonstrated decisively, Israel was
not simply another Jewish community in the constellation but the
center of the world for Jews. 
</p><p align="justify">
The Jewry that greeted the new state was no longer an expanding
one which was gaining population even in the face of the
attrition of intermarriage and assimilation.  On the contrary, it
was a decimated one (even worse, for decimated means the loss of
one in ten; the Jews lost one in three); a Jewry whose very
physical survival had been in grave jeopardy and whose rate of
loss from defections came close to equaling its birth rate.
Moreover, the traditional strongholds of Jewish communal life in
Eastern Europe and the Islamic World, which were also areas with
a high Jewish reproduction rate, were those that had been wiped
out. 
</p><p align="justify">
By the end of the 1940s, the centers of Jewish life had shifted
decisively away from Europe to Israel and North America. By then,
continental Europe as a whole ranked behind Latin America, North
Africa, and Great Britain as a force in Jewish life.  In fact,
its Jews were almost entirely dependent upon financial and
technical assistance from the United States and Israel.  Except
for those in the Muslim countries that were soon virtually to
disappear, the major functioning Jewish communities all had
acquired sufficient size to become significant factors on the
Jewish scene only within the previous two generations.  In
effect, the shapers of those communities were still alive, and in
many cases were still the actual community leaders.  The Jewish
world had been willy-nilly thrown back to a pioneering stage. 
</p><p align="justify">
This new epoch is still in its early years, hardly more than
a single generation, hence its character is still in its
formative stages.  Nevertheless, with the establishment of the
State of Israel in 1948 the Jewish polity began a constitutional
change of revolutionary proportions, inaugurating a new epoch in
Jewish constitutional history.  For the first time in almost two
millennia, the majority of the Jewish people were presented with
the opportunity to attain citizenship in their own state. Indeed,
Israel's very first law (Hok Hashevut -- the Law of Return)
specified that citizenship would be granted to any Jew-qua-Jew
wishing to settle in Eretz Israel. 
</p><p align="justify">
The reestablishment of a Jewish state has restored a sense of
political involvement among Jews and shaped a new institutional
framework within which the business of the Jewish people is
conducted.  The virtual disappearance of the remaining legal or
even social and cultural barriers to individual free choice in
all but a handful of countries has made free association the
dominant characteristic of Jewish life in the post-modern era.
Consequently, the first task of each Jewish community has been to
learn to deal with the particular local manifestation of this
freedom. 
</p><p align="justify">
The new voluntarism extends itself into the internal life of
the Jewish community as well, generating pluralism even in
previously free but relatively homogeneous community structures.
This pluralism is increased by the breakdown of the traditional
reasons for being Jewish and the rise of new incentives for
Jewish association.  At the same time, the possibilities for
organizing a pluralistic Jewish community have also been enhanced
by these new incentives.  What has emerged is a matrix of
institutions and individuals linked through a unique
communications network; a set of interacting institutions which,
while preserving their own structural integrity and filling their
own functional roles, are informed by shared patterns of culture,
activated by a shared system of organization and governed by
shared leadership cadres. 
</p><p align="justify">
The character of the matrix which has emerged and its
communications network varies from community to community.  In
some communities, the network is connected through a common
center which serves as the major (but rarely, if ever, the
exclusive) channel for communication.  In others, the network
forms a matrix without any center, with the lines of
communication crisscrossing in all directions.  In all cases, the
boundaries of the community are revealed only when the pattern of
the network is uncovered.  The pattern itself stands revealed
only when both of its components are -- namely, its institutions
and organizations with their respective roles and the way in
which communications are passed between them. 
</p><p align="justify">
The pattern itself is inevitably a dynamic one.  That is to
say, there is rarely a fixed division of authority and influence
but, rather, one that varies from time to time and usually from
issue to issue, with different elements in the matrix taking on
different "loads" at different times and relative to different
issues.  Since the community is a voluntary one, persuasion
rather than compulsion, influence rather than power, are the only
tools available for making and executing policies.  This, too,
works to strengthen its character as a communications network
since the character, quality, and relevance of what is
communicated and the way in which it is communicated frequently
determine the extent of the authority and influence of the
parties to the communication. 
</p><p align="justify">
The structure of the contemporary Jewish polity is that of a
network of single and multipurpose functional authorities, no
single one of which encompasses the entire gamut of Jewish
political interests, although several have attempted to do so in
specific areas: 
</p>
<OL type="1">
	<LI> <p align="justify"> "National Institutions" -- e.g., the Jewish Agency, the World
 Zionist Organization, Jewish National Fund; </p>
	<LI> <p align="justify">multicountry associations -- e.g., ORT, the World Jewish
Congress; </p>
	<LI> <p align="justify"> educational institutions defined as under the auspices of
the entire Jewish people -- e.g., the universities in Israel;  </p>
	<LI><p align="justify">  organizations under more specific local sponsorship whose
	 defined sphere of activity is multicountry -- e.g., the Joint
	 Distribution Committee.</p> 
</OL>

<p align="justify">
Another way of grouping the multicountry associations is by
their principal goals.  Here are the broad categories, with

In the late 1940s and the 1950s the reconstruction and
reconstitution of existing communities, and the founding of new
ones, were the order of the day throughout the Jewish world.  The
Jewish communities of continental Europe all underwent periods of
reconstruction or reconstitution in the wake of wartime losses,
changes in the formal status of religious communities in their
host countries, immigration to Israel, internal European
migrations, and the introduction of new, especially Communist,
regimes.  Those of the Muslim countries were transformed in
response to the convergence of two factors: the establishment of
Israel and the anticolonial revolutions in Asia and Africa.  The
greater portion of the Jewish population in those countries was
transferred to Israel and organized Jewish life beyond the
maintenance of local congregations virtually came to an end in
all of them except Iran, Morocco, and Tunisia. 
</p><p align="justify">
The English-speaking Jewries and, to a somewhat lesser extent,
those of Latin America, were faced with the more complex task of
adapting their organizational structures to three new purposes:
to assume responsibilities passed to them as result of the
destruction of European Jewry, to play a major role in supporting
Israel, and to accommodate internal changes in communities still
in the process of acculturation.  Many of the transient Jewish
communities in Asia and Africa were actually founded or given
organized form in this period, while others, consisting in the
main of transient merchants or refugees, were abandoned. 
</p><p align="justify">
At first, the patterns of Jewish communal organization in the
diaspora followed those of the modern epoch with some
modifications, but as the post-modern epoch plants its own
imprint, the differences in status and structure are diminishing.
A common organizations pattern is emerging, consisting of certain
basic elements, including: 
</p>

<ol><LI><p align="justify">
 Government-like institutions, whether "roof" organizations or
separate institutions serving discrete functions, that play roles
and provide services on all planes (countrywide, local, and, when
used, intermediate) which, under other conditions, would be
placed, provided or controlled -- predominantly or exclusively --
by governmental authorities (for instance, external relations,
defense, education, social welfare, and public -- that is,
communal -- finance), specifically: 
</p><ul><LI><p align="justify">

</p></ul>
<LI><p align="justify">Localistic institutions and organizations that provide a means

synagogue unions, federations, or confederations); 
</p><LI><p align="justify">local cultural and recreational centers, often federated or
confederated with one another. 
</p></ul>
<LI><p align="justify">
General purpose mass-based organizations, operating
countrywide on all planes, that function to (a) articulate
community values, attitudes, and policies; (b) provide the energy
and motive force for crystallizing the communal consensus that
grows out of those values, attitudes, and policies; and (c)
maintain institutionalized channels of communication between the
community's leaders and "actives" ("cosmopolitans") and the broad
base of the affiliated Jewish population ("locals") for dealing
with the problems and tasks facing the community in the light of
the consensus, specifically: 
 </p>
<ul><LI><p align="justify">

</p><LI><p align="justify">
 fraternal organizations. 
</p></ul>
<LI><p align="justify"> Special interest organizations which, by serving specialized

                         <CENTER><H3>Considerations </H3></CENTER>
<p align="justify">

What broader considerations can be derived from the Jewish
experience?  Four points can be made in particular: 
</p><p align="justify">
1) Long-term diasporas seem to be an Asian phenomenon, in that
the peoples who seem to be able to produce and sustain diasporas
are overwhelmingly Asian or have emerged from Asia.  European
emigres to new territories break off into fragments of their
original cultures, as Louis Hartz has pointed out in The Founding
of New Societies, and then become separate peoples in their own
right.49  Traditional African cultures remained tribal, even in
the case of the great tribal empires, and handled migration
within Africa through the break-off of families or clans and their
reconstitution as new tribes.  Africans who migrated outside of
Africa did so on a forced basis as slaves and hence were given no
chance to establish a diaspora.  Although in recent times there
has been some effort to impose a diaspora-style context on
American Blacks, it has not succeeded.  It seems that the nature
of peoplehood in Asia and its relationship to statehood --
whereby peoples are far more enduring than states -- whereby
peoples are far more enduring than states -- is an essential
condition for the creation of diasporas.  The Jews are a prime
example of an Asian people who carried their diaspora first into
North Africa, then Europe, and then into the New World, but they
never lost this Asian dimension of their being. 
</p><p align="justify">
2) A second point is that the Jewish experience is the
quintessential example of how diasporas can be state-initiators.
The history of the reestablishment of the State of Israel may be
the classic of its kind, but it is not the only such example.  It
was the Norwegian diaspora in the United States which initiated
the separation of Norway from Sweden, which led to Norwegian
independence in 1905, and the Czech diaspora which initiated the
establishment of Czechoslovakia after World War I.  At any given
time there may be a number of diasporas that are actively trying
to establish states, the Armenians, for example.  This is an
important dimension in the reciprocal state-diaspora
relationship.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">50</FONT></SUP> 
</p><p align="justify">
3) A third point is that the nature of interflows between state
and diaspora and segments of the diaspora need to be more fully
examined.  This article has suggested some of those interflows in
the contemporary Jewish world.  Elsewhere, I have mapped the
shifting nature of such flows and the different institutional
frameworks for them in different epochs of Jewish history.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">51</FONT></SUP>
</p><p align="justify">
What has been characteristic of the Jews is that at times they
have had highly visible frameworks for such interflows.  We have
already noted how, in the days of the Second Temple, Jews
throughout the world made pilgrimage and paid an annual Temple
tax as well as accepted the authority of the Sanhedrin, which sat
in the Temple.  Several hundred years later, the Resh Galuta and
yeshivot in Babylonia exercised authority over up to 97 percent of
the Jews of the world who happened to be within the Arab
caliphate. At other times, the institutional structure was
articulated but not quite as apparent to most Jews, even if they
were influenced by it.  That is the condition today with the
various authorities which link Israel and the diaspora and the
various diaspora communities with one another.  What is becoming
clear to those involved is that the reconstituted Jewish Agency
for Israel and its constituent organizations are beginning to
play a similar role on a voluntary basis. 
</p><p align="justify">
Finally, there were situations where external conditions
prevented any visible institutional framework other than the
institutions of local decision-making, whereby <i>halakhic</i>
authorities from all parts of the Jewish world were in
correspondence with one another and turned to one another for
decisions binding on the entire Jewish people.  The
communications between these authorities helped maintain the
formal constitutional structure of the Jewish people, which
helped keep the Jewish constitutional framework intact even when
Jews had no political institutions to unite them.  This formal
legal framework was supplemented by the continuing movement of
travelers and migrants among most, if not all, of the communities
of the Jewish world at any given time, which served to preserve
the ethnic as well as the constitutional ties uniting the Jewish
people. 
</p><p align="justify">
4) Finally, any proper study of state-diaspora relations should
consider the role of technology in making possible the
maintenance of links between diaspora and state or one diaspora
community and another.  At the beginning of the Jewish diaspora,
2500 years ago or more, it is very likely that Jews who spread
beyond the limits of continued communication with their brethren,
given the technologies of the time (such as the Jews who settled
in China), disappeared as Jews.  No doubt, the fact that first
the Persians and then the Romans emphasized road building to
facilitate communication among the far flung reaches of their
respective empires had a vital impact on the Jews' efforts in
maintaining their links. 
</p><p align="justify">
Later, in medieval times, the relative ease of water
communication in the Mediterranean world held the Jewish
communities of the Mediterranean Basin together while Jews who
moved north of the Alps, while not out of communication with the
rest of the Jewish world, developed a subculture of their own.
The two subcultures persist to this day in the form of Sephardim
and Ashkenazim. 
</p><p align="justify">
In our own times, it is clear that the possibility of reviving
common institutions for the Jewish people has been strengthened
by the availability of such instruments as the telephone and the
jet plane which makes it possible to be in constant communication
throughout the Jewish world and for Jewish leaders from all over
to meet regularly with relative ease. For the first time in
Jewish history, makes it possible for there to be day-to-day
involvement in the governance of the worldwide Jewish polity.
Thus a whole new page has been opened in the relationships
between land, state, and diaspora. </p>
