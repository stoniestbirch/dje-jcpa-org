<H3> The Facts of the Case:
</H3><p align="justify">

 Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the
 Mormons) have been present in Israel for a long time. Because of
 their belief that Jews would return to their land as a "sign of
 the time" of the second coming, the Mormon missionary Orson Hyde
 was sent to Jerusalem by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church
 in 1841, only ten years after the founding of the Church.  Hyde
 recited a "Zionist prayer" and dedicated the land to the Jews from
 atop the Mount of Olives.</p><p align="justify">


 Today, there is a Latter Day Saints Church in Jerusalem which
 holds services on Saturdays, and the modern Brigham Young
 University (BYU) program has been functioning in Israel for
 seventeen years, operating out of East Jerusalem and Kibbutz Ramat
 Rachel on the southwest border of city.  Over 1850 students have
 participated in this eight-month program since 1977.</p><p align="justify">

 A number of years ago, BYU decided to build a permanent home for
 the program and brought their request before Jerusalem Mayor Teddy
 Kollek.  The original request had been for a site on the western
 side of the city, between the King David Hotel and Hebrew Union
 College. The Mayor decided that the eastern side of the city would
 be a better location, probably in the wake of ultra-Orthodox
 extremist attacks on Christian institutions in the western part of
 the city, including the burning down of the Baptist Church in
 Rehavia.</p><p align="justify">

 All the parties agreed upon the present site on the slope of Mount
 Scopus. This site was transferred to the Mormons after their
 request passed through all the regular channels, including the
 municipality, the regional building committee, and the appropriate
 ministries. All of these agencies signed the request without it
 becoming a public issue.</p><p align="justify">

 After construction was underway, a public committee was organized
 to oppose the building on the grounds that its real purpose was
 the establishment of a headquarters for Mormon missionizing of
 Jews. The committee was initially composed solely of Orthodox
 Jews, though others have been attracted to it, including at least
 one member of Hashomer Hatzair.  The committee has succeeded in
 mobilizing much of the Orthodox Jewish establishment to oppose the
 Mormon center, turning it into a serious public issue.</p><p align="justify">

 In the meantime, there have been revelations of routine Mormon
 missionizing here in Israel at least through 1982.  In
 correspondence from 1977, Dr. David Galbraith, the present head of
 the Brigham Young University program here, wrote to his
 counterparts in Utah suggesting the need for a substantial
 building in Jerusalem which would enable missionizing to take
 place.  However, transfer of the Mount Scopus site to the Mormons
 was based upon a pledge from them that there would be no
 missionizing in Israel.  After some hesitation, this pledge was
 delivered in writing.  Galbraith and his associates say that
 whatever their plans were in 1977, they respect the laws of the
 country and the wishes of the inhabitants and they will not
 missionize here, just as they do not in certain other countries in
 the world, such as Egypt, Pakistan and the Soviet Union (where, we
 might add, they would be put to death for missionizing, unlike in
 Israel).
</p><BR>
<p align="justify">
 <H3>The Major Problems:
</H3></p><p align="justify">
 In addition to the issue of Jewish sensibilities towards being
 missionized, especially in their own land, the major problem with
 the Mount Scopus site involves its prominent and visible location,
 in close proximity to the Hebrew University and its position
 across the valley from the Temple site.  The Mormons have a strong
 reputation as being very devoted missionizers, with over 30,000
 missionaries operating around the world (out of a total membership
 of 5 million).  They organize their missionary activities
 systematically and put great effort into them. Every LDS member
 must spend two years of his or her life in the service of the
 Church.  These volunteers are spread throughout the world as
 missionaries.  On the other hand, the Mormons have shown strong
 support for Israel in the past and have revealed a basic
 friendliness to Jewish aspirations in Israel, an attitude which
 Israel can scarcely afford to jeopardize.

</p><p align="justify">

 The question of what constitutes freedom of religion in this case
 adds another dimension to the issue. Were a local Mormon group
 seeking to build a house of worship, there could be no complaint;
 but the project under discussion is proposed by and for
 "outsiders" who wish to build an edifice of monumental proportions
 on a most prominent site. Israel has an obligation to protect the
 freedom of religion of its citizens but need not grant outsiders
 the same rights.  However, if, as Jews claim, Jerusalem is indeed
 the spiritual center of the world, outsiders must be granted a
 place here, including those Christians who view proselytizing and
 missionizing as part of their faith.</p><p align="justify">

 Mormon theology is itself an ancillary, though less tangible
 issue.  Mormons see themselves as Jews of the tribe of Ephraim,
 one of the tribes of Joseph, whereas Jews are thought by them to
 be of the descendants of Judah. This means that Mormons hold
 themselves as coequal in status to "other Jews,"  which is why to
 them all non-Mormons except Jews are "gentiles."  Therefore, in
 terms of their theology and long-range concerns, their presence on
 Mount Scopus is far more meaningful for them than a simple
 university center.</p><p align="justify">

 This dilemma is compounded by the fact that the building is going
 up very rapidly.  The opposition is becoming more intense and
 threats of violence against the building have already been heard.
 The Mormons now employ fifteen security guards at the construction
 site.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3> Other Christian Groups:</H3></p><p align="justify">

 The larger issue must also be addressed:  Once the Mormons build
 their Center, other Christian groups will demand a significant
 presence in Jerusalem as well and will seek equally prominant and
 visible sites-- presently, over thirty organized Churches operate
 in Israel.  In addition, the tension--even animosity--between the
 Church of the Latter-day Saints and "mainstream " Christianity
 must be considered.  The establishment of a Mormon presence on the
 proposed scale will present a challenge to other Christian groups
 to whom Israel will then be unable to deny equal access as their
 right.  If the Mormons do build, some guarantee against
 missionizing will have to be made part of the charter agreement if
 constant battle is to be avoided (although such a guarantee would
 not necessarily deflect the opposition of groups opposing a
 substantial Christian presence in Jerusalem as a threat to Jewish
 survival).
</p><BR>
<H3><p align="justify">
 What are the Options?:</p></H3><ol><LI><p align="justify">

Take whatever legal steps are necessary, including legislation
 on the part of the Knesset, to have construction stopped.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Allow the building to be completed and accept the Mormon's
 pledge that they will not missionize in Israel.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Make every effort to reach a compromise involving financial
 compensation and acceptance by the Mormons of an alternative, less
 prominent, site in Jerusalem.
</p><LI><p align="justify">
  Seek a comprehensive agreement with all Christian groups,
 allowing them a presence here on condition that Jerusalem and
 Israel be declared places of inter-religious dialogue and declared
 off-limits for missionizing or proselytizing of any kind.</p></ol><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3> Recommendations:</H3></p><ol><LI><p align="justify">

The State of Israel should officially recognize the special
 role of Jerusalem as a spiritual center and allow legitimate
 groups to come and build in Jerusalem, provided that they agree
 not to missionize.  To this end we recommend the creation of a
 "Covenant of Peace" which would pledge all parties to recognize
 Jerusalem and Israel as a place for dialogue and not for
 proselytizing.  Such a "Covenant of Peace" would not only place
 people on their honor in creating an atmosphere of mutual respect,
 but would create a mutual interest in upholding and safeguarding
 the terms of the covenant in order to insure that all parties
 remain equally restrained and that no one group achieves an
 advantage over the others-in short, mutual respect will create
 mutual vigilance.</p><LI><p align="justify">

  An area in Jerusalem should be set aside for the construction
 of buildings of this nature.  One possible area is the area more
 or less between Tantur and Mar Elias at the southern edges of the
 city. This is within the city limits, but is not a site which is
 likely to provoke more than the minimum of anger on the part of
 those who will reject a solution on any terms.</p><LI><p align="justify">

  Persuading the Mormons to transfer their plans to an area of
 this type to avoid the necessity of protecting their building from
 potential violence for an indefinite period would be desireable.
 Of course the Mormons would have to be compensated under such an
 arrangement.  Failing that, it will probably be necessary to allow
 the Mormons to complete their project, but to take appropriate
 steps to assure that all future construction by non-Jewish
 religious institutions would be in a site specially zoned for that
 purpose.  The municipality should be willing to establish what
 would develop into an esthetically attractive religious park, as
 well as standard procedures by which legitimate groups could
 acquire sites there.
