<I>In the modern concept of rights developed in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, variously formulated as "life, liberty and
property" or "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"
rights transcend civil society, which then translates them into
constitutional, civil, criminal, and property rights.  In
contrast, the traditional Jewish view on rights is derived from
the biblical sense of the obligation of all humans to God as
their creator, sovereign, and covenant partner. Fundamental to
the Jewish conception is the principle that God is the creator
and sovereign of the universe, all of which ultimately belongs to
Him including all life within it.  What emerges out of the
biblical approach are a series of protections and limitations
which can roughly be translated into rights and obligations.
While humans have nothing other than what God grants or covenants
with them, as God's possessions no human instrumentality,
certainly no state, can legitimately interfere with their
God-given rights, liberties, protections, or obligations.  While
there may not be natural rights, there are fundamental rights in
the sense that all humans are bound by covenant with God, at
least through the Noahide covenant. These fundamental rights are
in that sense constitutional or federal rather than inherent. A
different agenda for the studying of obligations, rights,
liberties, and protections must be developed to deal with
classical Jewish thought and the subsequent Jewish experience.</I></p><p align="justify"><BR>


                <H3><CENTER>Rights in the Contemporary World</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
The conventional wisdom in our rights-conscious age is that there
is nothing quite as fixed and permanent as rights.  The only
changes that take place in connection with them are in connection
with an expanded understanding of what constitute individual
rights, their scope, and meaning.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>  Serious students of the
subject know that this is not exactly the case, that the very
concept of rights as we understand it is a modern one developed
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as one of the
foundation stones of modern democracy.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

We begin by trying to understand what we are looking for. Present
understandings of rights are all derived from modernity; hence we
can begin with the two most prominent modern formulations, that
of Locke -- "life, liberty and property" -- and that of the U.S.
Declaration of Independence -- "life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness."  The last of the Declaration's triad subsumes the
right of property while defining a broader right to pursue
happiness which is not directly defined.  Under modern and
post-modern rights doctrine, at least these rights are inherent
in all humans and inalienable.  At most, humans can come together
for collective action in such a way that they delegate some
control over the expression and effectuation of these rights to
their common association in which they retain a decision-making
role, directly or indirectly.  
</p><p align="justify">
These rights transcend civil society, which then translates them
into constitutional, civil, criminal, and property rights.
Throughout much of the modern period, the rights directly
associated with the two triads were considered to be natural
rights.  In the postmodern epoch they are defined as human
rights.  In either case, the theory provides that humans start
with those rights and assume obligations only as they agree to
enter civil society.  In that sense, at least, obligations are
secondary to rights and so they have come to be treated in
rights-based Western democracies.  The notion that for every
right there is a corresonding responsibility or duty is not
unknown and indeed is embodied in a number of contemporary
constitutions, but it has been principally associated with
less-than-democratic if not totalitarian regimes, offering them a
means to pay obeisance to human rights while at the same time
making it possible for the state to radically or drastically
restrict their exercise.</p><p align="justify">

Leo Strauss has taught us the difference between the modern and
premodern philosophic understanding of rights and "right."
Premodern classical philosophy understood natural right as part
of natural law, a normative standard built into the universe.
Classical natural right was related to the good life and the good
commonwealth, which, while difficult of attainment by human
beings, could be achieved with the right convergence of
conditions and forces. 
</p><p align="justify">
The good life within the good commonwealth was grounded in an
appropriate understanding of the ideal public order and the
duties of men in their efforts to achieve it. Modern natural
rights, on the other hand, adhere exclusively to individuals and
are derived from their natural psychology, "scientifically"
discovered.  Rights adhere to individuals qua individuals, and
while their preservation is the highest norm, as rights they are
not associated with normative goals but rather with the
preservation of individual life and liberty as (close to)
absolutes.  Rooted in methodological individualism, they reflect
the liberal principle that the individual is the only atom from
which to begin the construction or analysis of civil society.  
</p><p align="justify">
While early modern thought recognized and emphasized that all
society is civil society, organized politically from its
foundations (in contradistinction to premodern organic views, or
nineteenth century views of the subject which sought the
"automatic society" that existed independently of political
organization), it also emphasizes that civil society's
governmental dimension should be limited; indeed as limited as
possible. For moderns of this school, civil society and
government were instituted by individuals (solely) to protect
their rights.  Inevitably, in such a system, individual rights
take precedence over all else, and every institution, including
the commonwealth, ultimately is judged by how well it protects
individual rights as defined. Since there is no other overarching
conception of the good, there is no standard against which to
measure individual behavior in the appropriate exercise of
individual rights other than the ambiguous question of injury to
others in the exercise of one's own rights.  
</p><p align="justify">
The entire edifice of modern political life, indeed, of modern
civil society, is constructed on this modern conception of
rights, first embodied constitutionally in the English Bill of
Rights of 1689 and expanded in the declarations of rights of the
American state constitutions beginning in 1776, the U.S. Bill of
Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man both
drafted in 1789. Its most recent and far-reaching expressions to
be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>  This
edifice is modified only to the extent that some would argue that
every right has correlative responsibilities, a position which is
viewed in certain quarters as less and less appropriate to
postmodern democracy and to contemporary civil society.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
In the United States, for example, the conception of what
constitutes rights among the thinking public has moved from the
early seventeenth century conception of rights as liberties
derived from prior obligations to modern individual rights to be
protected by government in the spirit of John Locke, to natural
rights as constitutional rights in the late eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, to the late twentieth century view of
natural rights as human rights that take precedence over all
social concerns.  That is where Americans are today.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify"><BR>


                  <H3><CENTER> The Traditional Jewish View</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

The traditional Jewish view offers a somewhat different position
on rights and obligations which is derived from the biblical
sense of human obligation to God as a result of our covenants
with Him.  To explore the traditional Jewish conceptions of
obligations and rights, we must be prepared to resolutely
confront a reality that is often very different from contemporary
theories.  We must do so without apologetics and most especially
without attempting to reconcile or harmonize Jewish views with
contemporary views in every case, unless it is clearly apropriate
to do so.
</p><p align="justify">
So problematic is the topic before us for contemporary humans
that the Encyclopedia Judaica has no entry at all under rights
and under obligations has entries only with regard to the
talmudic laws of property.  While some of the issues raised here
are treated in that work by eminent experts such as Judges Haim
Cohn and Menahem Elon, they are subsumed under other categories.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT>
The Hebrew terms we use today to define rights are strictly
modern ones whose usage was established within the last 100
years, as part of the development of modern Hebrew, in line with
contemporary Western thought.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

After we complete our analysis we may be able to draw certain
conclusions, but we must fully and frankly face the possibility
that the Jewish tradition in this respect is radically different
from the rights doctrines that we all have learned as normative.
Our goal here as scholars is understanding.  Whatever personal
conclusions we draw from that understanding must be drawn
separately.
</p><p align="justify">
We begin with the fact that Jewish tradition derives rights from
the obligation of all humans to God as their creator, sovereign,
and covenant partner. Fundamental to any Jewish conception here
is the principle that God is the creator and sovereign of the
universe, all of which ultimately belongs to Him -- "<I>Ki li kol
ha'aretz</I>" (because the whole earth is Mine) -- including all life
within it (Ex. 19:5; Lev. 25:23).  </p><p align="justify">

At the same time, since God's universe is founded on <I>tzedakah
u'mishpat</I> (justice or right in the German sense of recht and law
in the sense of right judgment), God's relations with His
creatures must have a dimension of what have been called rights
and liberties built in, as it were.  Humans have what we call
rights and liberties by the authority of our covenant with God.
Whether or not <I>tzedakah u'mishpat</I> are built into the very fabric
of the universe (i.e., represent the biblical equivalent of
natural law) or are the products of covenant is a matter of some
dispute among students of biblical and Jewish thought.  This
writer believes that while the potential for <I>tzedek</I> (justice) may
be built into the universe, <I>tzedakah u'mishpat</I> exists by covenant
and certainly must be actualized through covenants.
</p><p align="justify">
<I>Tzedakah u'mishpat</I> are of the essence in biblical rights
terminology.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT>  They are invoked by<I> tzaakah</I> (literally, calling
out) or appeal, what appears in the Bible to be a formal step;
that is to say, where <I>tzedakah u'mishpat</I> are violated the victims
can appeal (<I>tzoak</I>) to God or to human kings for redress.
(Contrast the situation where humans must appeal to God for mercy
because they have no particular rights at stake.) Moshe Greenberg
argues that, according to the Bible, government is instituted
among men to protect the <I>tzedakah u'mishpat</I> of the weak and
perhaps solely for that purpose.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

The special significance of this for our topic is that while
humans have nothing other than what God grants or covenants with
them, as God's possessions no human instrumentality, certainly no
state, can legitimately interfere with their God-given rights,
liberties, protections, or obligations.  Once God has commanded
or covenanted (and his commandments are based upon His
covenants), no human authority or agency has the right to
interpose itself without the consent of those commanded or those
who are partners to the covenant.  As we all know, this, indeed,
is the foundation of the modern development of rights, growing
out of sixteenth and seventeenth century Reformed Protestantism
which took these matters very seriously indeed.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT> 
</p><p align="justify">
While partnership with God is based upon humans' acceptance of
their covenant obligations toward Him, those rest upon the
establishment of a certain measure of equality between God and
humans, itself a very daring idea.  Only those with at least a
minimum of equality can be partners.  Since the Bible projects an
omnipotent, omniscient and eternal God while all humans are
mortal and limited, even after eating from the tree of knowledge,
that partnership is essentially a functional one, confined to
certain tasks of <I>yishuv ha-aretz</I> (the settlement of the earth)
and <I>tikkun olam</I> (the repair of the world); in other words, the
earthly tasks of this world where humans increasingly have played
a major role in God's scheme of things.  It is by virtue of that
partnership and the obligations that flow from it that humans
have rights that are real rights, not at all diminished by being
derived from obligations. Nevertheless, because they are rights
that flow from God's covenant with humans, they are to some
extent conditional on humans' maintaining their part of the
covenantal bargain.  In the language of the Puritans, they have a
federal (<I>foedus</I> is the Latin term for covenant, a translation of
brit) obligation, fulfillment of which guarantees their federal
liberty, of which more below.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">
The character of biblically-mandated obligations thus relates to
the character of the covenant in question.  Thus, humanity as a
whole is bound by the Noahide covenant (Genesis 9), based on the
common obligation of all to the recognition of God's sovereignty,
the protection of human life, and the pursuit of justice on
earth. For Jews, who are further bound by the covenant of Sinai,
there is a further obligation of holiness (Deuteronomy 19-21) as
the highest form of imitation of God.  Whether or not the Jewish
people in this respect were to be the pioneers for the rest of
humanity or whether their holines is forever exclusive is a
question that has been the subject of some discussion.  (Many
Christians see themselves so bound but with a twist.)  While it
does have a bearing on rights of citizenship, what bearing it has
on human rights is an open question.  On basic matters of human
right to life, sustenance, property (within limits), and justice,
the Bible explicitly provides that "the stranger within thy
gates" has the same rights as Israelites, even in the land of
Israel (cf. Ex. 23:9; Lev. 25:23; Deut. 15:29).  What the outer
limits of those basic rights are has been a matter of some
discussion over the years.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">
What is critical about the relationship between rights and
obligations in the biblical tradition and in subsequent Jewish
tradition is that those covenanted with God are obligated to
their fellows under the terms of the covenant to do them justice,
from whence derives their right to justice.  The covenant
partners are obligated because they are covenant partners.  For
Jews the obligation is that they must do justice to the widow and
the orphan and the stranger in order to be holy (Ex. 23:9; Deut.
15:29).  So it is not that the widows, orphans and strangers have
rights in an abstract sense, but that they can call upon their
fellow Israelites to live up to their obligations.  
</p><p align="justify">
Is this merely a semantic point?  I think not, because Israelites
are equally obligated to do justice in the form of punishing
those who are violators of God's covenant, who cannot claim some
a priori natural or human right to be protected against such
punishments.  What they can claim on constitutional grounds is
that the Israelites must live up to their obligations. In some
respects that is an even stronger claim than a rights claim.  But
however it is perceived, it is a different one.
</p><p align="justify">
Even more than that, rights themselves are expressed as
obligations.  Thus humans have an obligation to remain alive and
to preserve the lives of others.  From this what moderns would
refer to as the right to life can be inferred, but in classical
Jewish sources it is expressed as the duty to maintain life --
your own and that of others -- a covenantal obligation, as it
were. Thus the duty to preserve life is derived from the belief
that it is God who bestows human life and therefore only He can
prescribe the ways in which it can be taken away.  Every human
has a duty to preserve his or her life as part of his or her
duties to God.
</p><p align="justify">
The issue is even more clearly joined in the case of property.
The right of humans to own and use property can be derived from
many scriptural statements of obligations, not the least of which
is the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal" (Ex. 20:13; Deut.
5:17).  Scripture also clearly states that all land and other
property ultimately belongs to God who prescribes the parameters
of its use by humans (Lev. 25:23).  Thus, for example, people can
own land.  If that land is another Jew's <I>nahalah</I> (biblical
inheritance) in Eretz Israel, it must be returned to the family
of the original owners at the appropriate jubilee year (Lev.
25:8ff).  While in a person's possession, agricultural land must
be governed by rules providing for the poor to glean, the worker
to eat of its produce, and the ox working the field not to be
muzzled (Lev. 25:1-7).
</p><p align="justify">
Over the years these restrictions on property rights were
interpreted broadly rather than narrowly to create a set of
environmental rights that recognized the special needs of
individual humans.  These included protections of the right to
sunlight that existed when a property was acquired, even at the
expense of preventing another from building on his adjacent
property in such a way that would interfere with that sunlight,
or a right to ventilation protected in the same way.  Whether
formally defined that way or not, these were essentially
duties/rights of <I>re'ut</I>, that is to say, neighborly comity of the
kind described in Deuteronomy (e.g., Deut. 23:25-26; 24:10;
27:17) constitutionally required of Israelites in the Torah.
Re'ut is an extension of hesed and as such is an obligation of
holiness on the part of covenant partners.</p><p align="justify">

A different and more extensive set of rights developed in the
area of criminal protections (Ex. 21-24).  In that field the
relevant biblical passages were built into a comprehensive system
of protection of the civil rights of individuals accused of
crimes. These protections were so extensive that at points they
bordered on the ridiculous as, for example, when certain Sages
suggested that only if a person was actually warned at the time
against committing the crime for which he was accused could that
person be held responsible. </p><p align="justify">

This ideal talmudic world of protection of the rights of the
accused was seized upon by many contemporary Jews to claim, not
improperly, that the Jewish people had pioneered in that field of
civil and communal rights protection.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT>  Indeed, their writings
even came to the attention of such bodies as the United States
Supreme Court which cited talmudic precedents in some of their
landmark cases.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT>  In fact, as we now know from the historical
evidence available to us, it seems that there is a question as to
whether these talmudic laws and standards were always enforced
since the more extreme ones seem to have been developed after the
autonomous Jewish authorities lost criminal law jurisdiction in
the Roman Empire.  In Babylonia, where the Resh Galuta acquired
such jurisdiction, it was customary for accused criminals to be
turned over to a parallel system of what might be called civil
courts under his authority where trial procedures were more in
conformity with the standards of the time, thereby preserving the
talmudic principles intact while at the same time being able to
administer a criminal justice system.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT>  Nevertheless, it can be
said that the right to life was well-protected at least for those
humans deemed bound by the Noahide covenant.
</p><p align="justify">
The Torah tends to be uncompromising in its expression of the
obligations of humans in general and Jews in particular.  The
other books of the Bible introduce loopholes, the most important
of which are associated with the <I>mishpat hamelekh</I> or <I>mishpat
hamelukhah</I> (the law of the king or of the kingdom), derived
particularly from I Samuel 8 where the prophet Samuel warns
Israelites against seeking a king because of the powers a king
inevitably has.  It seems that even in biblical times kings
exercised power over and above Torah constraints.  Subsequently
the idea of the <I>mishpat hamelekh</I> as a loophole, especially
against stringent aspects of of the criminal law.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

What emerges out of the biblical approach are a series of
protections and limitations which can roughly be translated into
rights and obligations as when the poor are given rights to glean
the fields during the harvest. Thus, many of these protections
and limitations become what we would call rights, as protected
through the Torah as any constitutional right is today.  The
result, as already noted, are rights and obligations stemming
from the federal relationship between humans and God, what John
Winthrop, the great Puritan governor of Massachusetts, was later
to define as "federal liberty."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">
In the last analysis, while there may not be natural rights,
there are fundamental rights in the sense that all humans are
bound by covenant with God, at least through the Noahide covenant
(some Christians would claim an earlier covenant with Adam as
well).  These fundamental rights are in that sense constitutional
or federal rather than inherent.  They certainly are not like the
vulgar modern conception of rights as the individual's right to
do whatever he or she pleases, perhaps limited only by how an
individual's actions effect others, but maybe not even by that.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>


                 <H3><CENTER> Who Can Be Obligated and How?</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

This leads to another question, namely, who can be obligated and
how.  We have already touched upon this question to some extent
in the preceding paragraphs, but it deserves to be sharpened
because it has to do with rights that are other than fundamental.
For example, while all humans are obligated by the Noahide
covenant to recognize God's sovereignty and pursue and do
justice, only Jews are obligated by the Sinai covenant to
maintain the more extensive norms -- social and ritual -- of that
covenant, and among traditional Jews there are distinctions
between men and women as to who is obligated to do what with
regard to rituals.
</p><p align="justify">No such distinctions prevail, however, with regard to those
obligations associated with what we understand to be rights.
There all are equally responsible.  The talmudic sages raise the
question as to whether those obligations extend only to fellow
Jews or to all humans.  Thus the famous discussion between Rabbi
Akiva and Ben Azzai, in which Rabbi Akiva states that the most
important verse in Torah is <I>veahavta l're'akha kamokha</I> (love thy
neighbor as thyself) (Lev. 19:18), while Ben Azzai claims that
even more important is the verse <I>elle toledot ha-adam </I>(these are
the generations of Adam) because <I>rea</I> (neighbor) has been
interpreted by some to apply only to fellow Jews while the second
verse clearly refers to the common descent of all humans and
hence their common equality before God (Gen. 5:1-2).  
</p><p align="justify">
<I>Re'ut</I> (neighborliness) is a good example of a biblical concept
related to what we could call rights.  It is a very important
covenant concept, dealing with those to whom we are obligated
beyond the letter of the law, what in Anglo-American
jurisprudence is referred to as comity and in German as <I>treu</I>.  In
that way it also reflects a certain right which <I>re'im</I> possess
toward one another.  Thus it is important to establish who is a
<I>re'a</I> to determine the scope of our obligations toward him.
</p><p align="justify">What is clear is that biblical terminology dealing with these
concepts is not our terminology.  The biblical term expressing
obligation is <I>hesed</I>, which is appropriately translated "loving
covenant obligation."  <I>La'asot hesed</I> (to act out of loving
covenant obligation) reflects the way the burden is on he who is
obligated to do what he does because of his covenant obligations
and is connected with holiness.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT>  No other biblical word relates
to what we call obligation.  The contemporary word for
obligation, <I>hovah</I>, comes into use only in the Middle Ages.</p><p align="justify">

Hesed is a very powerful word and a very covenantal one.  It
cannot be understood apart from its covenantal dimension and the
moral authority embodied within it is a very heavy one. There are
three related biblical terms that relate to the concept of
rights: <I>yosher, tzedek,</I> and <I>mishpat</I>.  <I>Yosher,</I> from <I>yashar</I>, has to
do with being straight -- with somebody or in one's own behavior.
<I>Tzedek</I> is concerned with doing justice and <I>mishpat</I> with
fulfilling the law.  All three clearly refer more to the
obligated party than to the possessor of the right.  <I>Yosher </I>may
possibly have some relationship to the latter as in Judges when
Israelites are described as <I>kol ish asa et ha-yashar b'einav</I>
(every man did what was right in his eyes), but that has to do
more with what is defined as the straight path than with the
possession of a right.
</p><p align="justify">
The one exception to all this lies in property rights as rights
of citizenship.  Every Jew has the right of <I>nahalah </I>(landed
inheritance) which is a familial right that entitles every
household to a permanent portion of the Land of Israel.  The
obligation of the Jubilee Year is designed to protect this right.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>


              <H3><CENTER> Exploring the Jewish Understanding
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
There are at least two ways to approach our discussion: One is
through the identification of contemporary categories of rights
and then to see whether there are corresponding rights in the
Jewish political tradition.  The other is to try to understand
how the Jewish political tradition approaches the problem of the
protection of humans from arbitrary exercise of power so as to
secure their freedom to act or to what extent is that even a
consideration in the classic Jewish political tradition.  Both
approaches are necessary to gain a proper understanding of the
subject.  
</p><p align="justify">
In his book Human Rights in Jewish Law, Judge Haim Cohn, after
making the point that in classical Jewish thought rights are
derived from or are expressed as duties, abstracts 25 rights from
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and presents their
correlates in Jewish law.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT>  He divides those rights into three
groups: 1) rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
2) rights of equality; 3) rights of justice.  His list is as
follows:</p>

<H3> I. Rights of Life, Liberty,and the Pursuit of Happiness

While Judge Cohn's starting point is contemporary rights theory
and he transposes Jewish tradition into contemporary rights
language, he does so honestly and fairly without claiming too
much or avoiding the limitations on rights and liberties under
Jewish law.  Still, he finds that within the context described
above, Jewish law protects virtually all of what are believed by
moderns and postmoderns to be fundamental human rights.  He shows
that those protections are derived from the Bible itself,
although in some cases their biblical basis had to be enlarged
through interpretation by subsequent sages.  
</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                 Transitions and Transformations
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
A somewhat more articulated theory of rights was developed in the
Talmud in the days of the tannaim and amoraim.  As elaborations
of the Torah, both the Mishnah and the Gemarah attempted to
elaborate specifics with regard to obligations and rights as in
every other field.  A new terminology began to develop with such
words as <I>zekhut</I> and its derivatives (e.g., <I>zakhai</I>) and <I>reshut</I> and
its derivatives (e.g., <I>rashai</I>) introduced (<I>kol sh'ani zakhai
b'amirato, rashai ani l'hakhshikh alav</I> [Shabbat 23:3]; <I>Sh'ain
doro zakkai l'kakh</I> [Sanhedrin 11]).  Here we begin to get a
conception of rights as such, albeit within the framework of the
obligations imposed on humanity through God's covenants and on
the Jews through the Torah.  Still the terms are most frequently
used in connection with property.
</p><p align="justify">The Talmudic discussions go into details of the enforcement of
obligations and, by implication, rights, often in an extremely
formalistic way, although at the same time they provide for a
sufficiently dynamic approach to include what Anglo-American law
defines as equity.  Based on Deuteronomy 6:18, "And thou shall do
what is right and good in the sight of the Lord," "right and
good" became the basis of equity in Talmudic jurisprudence.
</p><p align="justify">
In addition to the Bible and the Talmud, one finds the issues of
rights treated in the medieval codes, the responsa, and
commentaries on the Bible, Talmud and codes.  All of these are
particularly important after the closing of the Talmud in the at
the end of the fifth and early sixth centuries and became
particularly important from the eighth century onward.  Their
role in the case of obligations and rights, much like their role
in other spheres of Jewish law, was to synthesize, elucidate, and
apply accepted rules to new situations.  
</p><p align="justify">
For our purposes, the greatest of the codes was Maimonides'
Mishneh Torah which provides the most detailed and comprehensive
listing of obligations and rights defined and explained.  The
Mishneh Torah has also served to bring together the <I>halakhah</I> and
the <I>mishpat hamelukhah</I> under one roof, so to speak. Nevertheless,
as important as it is, it is not simply authoritative.  Different
interpretations of the meaning of certain obligations and rights
are to be found among different sources throughout the medieval
period, even when normative Judaism was dominant.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">
The Talmud also brought with it the beginnings of a rights
terminology, although essentially in relationship to property,
not to rights as we know them.  That terminology was further
developed and amplified in the medieval codes and commentaries.
As to be expected, the Hebrew usage took its cues from common
medieval usage and reflected a premodern European or Islamic
conception of right rather than a modern conception of rights.
</p><p align="justify">
With the coming of the modern epoch in the mid-seventeenth
century and the Jewish emancipation that followed in its wake,
particularly after the American and French Revolutions, modern
Jews began to think in terms of rights as preceding obligations.
A rather unusual example of this was the actual inclusion of a
bill of rights in the 1790 constitution of Congregation Shearith
Israel, the oldest congregation in the United States.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT> While
that was exceptional, congregational community constitutions did
undergo changes as their ability to oblige their members to
behave in acceptable ways diminished in the face of the
increasingly voluntary character of membership.  This happened
first in the United States and, until the twentieth century, only
to a lesser extent in Europe, but still it happened wherever Jews
were emancipated.</p><p align="justify">

A contemporary Hebrew terminology of rights dates from the modern
epoch.  For the most part it was developed by the maskilim,
either in the German <I>haskalah</I> (Jewish enlightenment), which came
at the time of the French and American Revolutions, or in some
cases a hundred years later by the leaders of the Eastern
European <I>haskalah</I>.  In some cases the terminology was not
developed until the twentieth century, either in the United
States or in Eretz Israel as part of the revival of the Hebrew
language at a time when Jews were consciously returning to the
political arena.  The principal term for rights, <I>zekhuyot</I>, was
adapted from talmudic and medieval usage, but was rather
substantially transformed.  To indicate how recent these
transformations took place, Yaakov Canaani's <I>Otzar Halashon
HaIvrit</I>, the most recent Hebrew dictionary on historical
principles, identifies certain usages as coming from the Eastern
European <I>haskalah</I> poet Y.L. Gordon, or from Daniel Persky, leader
of the American Hebrew movement between the world wars.</p><p align="justify">

In the last analysis, however, even under modern conditions
Jewish doctrine begins with obligations from which rights are
derived rather than vice versa.  It may have become a matter of
free choice as to whether to accept the obligations involved, but
still the obligations take precedence.  Thus in the most secular
kind of situation a Jew is obligated to join a Jewish community
and pay appropriate membership fees or taxes before being able to
enjoy any of the rights or privileges of membership.  While this
is a pale reflection of the biblical covenantal tradition, it is
still an extension of that tradition.  The precedence of
obligation continues to be part of the postmodern Jewish
experience where issues such as the rights of women in ritual
matters for some also hinge on acceptance of commensurate
halakhic obligations.  Thus even as Jews have become modern in
their understanding of human rights, they have retained more
traditional Jewish notions in connection with Jewish matters.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                    What Needs to be Studied
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
Given the foregoing, it should be clear that a different agenda
for the studying of obligations, rights, liberties, and
protections must be developed to deal with classical Jewish
thought and the subsequent Jewish experience.  These include the
original and changing nature of obligations as rights or limits
on rights, and why; the relationship between justice and
holiness; how loopholes are used in justification; historic
transformations of the accepted understanding of obligations and
rights; the problem of coercion; the relationship of political
and civil, public and private, obligations and rights.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                           Conclusion
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
If one were to try to summarize the basic Jewish theory from
which rights are derived, I would suggest the following five
points:</p>
<OL type="1">
	<LI><p align="justify">God is sovereign over all humans and the universe.</p><p align="justify">
	<LI>All humans are created equal and, through Adam and Eve, are
	 descended from the same ancestors, so that no primordial
	 distinctions can be made among them.</p><p align="justify">

	<LI>As equals all can covenant and assume partnership obligations
	with God.</p><p align="justify">
	<LI>All must covenant or accept being bound by covenant in order
 to have what we call rights, which are essentially obligations
 that either can be inferred from the terms of the covenant or are
	 obligations that are themselves rights.</p><p align="justify">
	<LI>  The result is federal liberty, that is to say, the liberty to
live according to the terms and obligations of the covenant which
in turn provides rights and protections.</p>
	
</OL><p align="justify">
The system presented in the Bible is among those that try to
accommodate the individual in the commonwealth without abandoning
the fabric of the commonwealth as a collectivity with its own
responsibilities.  The basis for this effort is three-fold: first
of all, the idea that every individual is created in the image of
God, has a soul, and is holy.  Second, that it is the task of the
individual and the community, indeed the individual in the
community, to strive to be holy by observing not only what are
today referred to as prescribed religious rituals, but by doing
justice, providing for the poor, maintaining human freedom and
dignity, and assuring a basic economic floor for every household.
</p><p align="justify">
Third, every individual is morally autonomous and his or her
consent is required for all acts, even in response to God's
commandments.  In biblical terminology, God commands but humans
hearken (shamoa).  That is to say, they listen to God's
commandment and in essence decide whether or not to observe it.
Biblical Hebrew has no word for obey.  All human actions require
hearkening.
</p><p align="justify">
Fourth, humans act together through covenants and covenanting,
beginning with the foundation of existence, man's covenant with
God, whereby God enters into a partnership with humans for the
fulfillment and governance of this world.  According to the terms
of the constitution which He has set before them, all human
organization flows from that original covenant and is ordered by
the subsidiary covenants to which the parties must consent and
which are morally binding under God who serves as partner,
guarantor, or witness.  All, of course, are based on consent and
the ability of the partners to make autonomous moral commitments.
</p><p align="justify">
While we do not know exactly how this biblical system worked in
practice in ancient Israel, we can gather some sense of its
reality in the way it has shaped the Jewish people who are noted
for their commitment to individual autonomy, liberty, and
equality, and for their striving to achieve one or another moral
end and the tendency to view public issues in moralistic terms
even as they are among the most communal, even tribal, of
peoples, tied together through a rich fabric of history and
destiny.
</p><p align="justify">
What of the matter of rights?  For the Bible, the question of
rights is derived essentially from the question of justice and
the human obligation of God to act justly.  Politics provides the
framework and the means to act justly and to do justice.  Thus
the fundamental associations of political community -- public and
private, civil and natural -- are media for doing justice.
</p><p align="justify">
Beyond that, each form of association forms a particular kind of
moral community within which justice is to be achieved and right
or rights protected in a diferent way.  One of the principal
lessons of the biblical teaching for us today is that humans are
organized in different moral communities, and right or rights
with regard to each must be treated in a manner appropriate to
it.
</p><p align="justify">
The modern worldview, by emphasizing the individual standing
naked against civil society as represented by government, has
increasingly come to emphasize the legal enforcement of legally
defined rights.  Originally applied to government alone, this
approach to rights has been extended to other forms of civil
associations and even more recently to natural associations,
public and private, because of that oversimple and limited
perception of the political relationship underlying civil
society, what constitutes rights, and how they are to be
enforced.
</p><p align="justify">In a just society, there must be an appropriate conceptualization
of right and rights for relationships within each different kind
of moral community with appropriate means of enforcement.  In
ancient and medieval society, much justice was promised without
sufficient means of enforcement.  Modern political thought
successfully attacked that problem by providing means of
enforcement but, in the process, rejected a more complex view of
what constitutes justice or right, a view based upon an
understanding of the different forms of association in which
humans are involved, recognizing the fact that all such
associations being established on the basis of covenant includes
the dimensions of justice and right and establishes or
systematizes relationships upon which appropriate theories of
rights and rights enforcement can be based.
</p><p align="justify">
We postmoderns understand the truth and vital importance of the
revolutionary modern idea of rights.  But we also understand that
while it may be the truth it is not necessarily the whole truth.
We may better understand that, while individual liberty is
essential for us all, so, too, are the institutions of family and
community so that the public institutions of civil society will
rest on the proper foundations; not only in the way that they are
constituted but in terms of the private dimension in which they
serve to function as they are intended to function.  The
character of the res publica (or commonwealth) depends on the
character of the public it serves and just as there can be no res
publica without a public so does the character of the res publica
rest upon the kind of public within it.

granting the use of public funds for religious instruction in
schools.  In Torcaso, Justice Black wrote the decision striking
down a provision in the Maryland constitution which required
prospective public officials to take an oath of faith in God.  In
Engel, Justice Black again wrote the decision striking down the
use of a non-sectarian prayer in New York schools.  In Schempp,
Bible-reading and the Lord's Prayer were prohibited from public
