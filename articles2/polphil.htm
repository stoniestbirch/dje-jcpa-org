<H3>Emil Fackenheim:</H3>
<p align="justify">
         
It is a striking phenomenon that while we have had a
state now for forty years, we do not have a political philosophy.
A disciplined political philosophy does not seem to exist.</p><p align="justify">


Of course many people think of ideology as the same as
philosophy.  But ideology is a partisan commitment; philosophy is
an attempt to try to transcend partisan commitments and, in the
case of a state, to grasp some of what the essence of a state is.
For example, the notion of the social contract strikes me as a
very profound one and if people talked in terms of a social
contract instead of fighting with each other, they could perhaps
reach a common core within their disagreements and obligations
toward each other.  This is just an example.  </p><p align="justify">

Now I myself think there is a very good reason why there is no
political philosophy.  I am sufficiently Hegelian to think that a
philosophy can arise only when the storm and stress of genesis is
over, which of course it is not.  It is not the case and this is
why right now we are fighting each other when we should be facing
a common enemy, at least that is my opinion.  Of course many
people think that is already ideology, that there is no common
enemy.  So this is the kind of difficulty we run into.  Still I
think, if may use Hegel's metaphor, to some extent, perhaps the
owl of Minerva may arise even though we are still in the full
warfare of daylight and the serene evening has not yet arrived.  </p><p align="justify">

This was our purpose and therefore we hoped that people would get
together who have very different political views, perhaps even
antagonistic views, and yet could find a common core.  After all
there is a common core of a Jewish state, at least one hopes so,
unless our enemies succeed in getting us to tear each other
apart.  So this is the general idea and everyone here is a
philosopher in the sense of having some philosophical discipline.
So perhaps we can begin to bring it to bear on some of the
crucial issues that concern our state.</p><p align="justify">

So, Daniel Elazar is today's speaker.  Last time I spoke about
the social contracts and I am not sure how far we got into the
discussion, but even if we failed, it showed that the conflicts
we still have are still very raw and that an attempt at
philosophizing is to be made even when it is very difficult.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>Daniel J. Elazar:</H3></p><p align="justify">
Last time, at the very end of our discussion, Eliezer Schweid
posed a question, namely how does a democracy resolve its
contradictions, and asked me to address it on the assumption,
which I share, that without contfronting that question we cannot
proceed any further with this endeavor.
</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>            Democratic Consent and its Contradictions
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Let me start by stipulating two points.  One, that a modern
democratic polity rests on the consent of its citizens and must,
if it is to be a democratic polity.  Indeed, any kind of modern
polity has to have a sufficient consent of its citizens to
survive.
</p><p align="justify">
Second, let me also stipulate that there are inevitably
contradictions, that there are problems in governing any polity,
no matter how democratic, that are problems for a democratic
theory.  Without considering the special situation of Israel, we
have at least three "normal" contradictions.  First, we have
issues of human nature, namely that there is some need for the
possibility of coercion to keep civil society in order.  Second,
we have issues of security which at some point necessitate
restrictions on the freedom of individuals.  This is a problem
that market economists face as well.  However efficient the
market, not everybody perceives their self-interest rightly, nor
is everybody willing to abide by the rules.  The same thing is
true in democratic states.  However far one might get with
voluntary cooperation on the part of 90 percent or more of the
population, there will be some who will not play by the rules and
whom the 90 percent must be able to coerce, in the hope that the
threat of coercion will keep them in line even without its use,
certainly not a new problem in political philosophy.  
</p><p align="justify">
The third normal contradiction is not so much a contradiction as
the fact that democracy has two dimensions.  Democracy is
self-government and democracy, certainly modern democracy
emphasizes the protection of individual rights.  As I say, this
is not necessarily a contradiction but there certainly are two
faces of democracy that have to be considered.  To think of
democracy only as the latter, as has frequently become the case
with contemporary democratic theorists is, it seems to me,
problematic.</p><p align="justify">

In addition, we have the special contradictions which Israeli
democracy faces.  One is the contradictions that arise from this
being a state of Jews that seeks in some way to be a Jewish state
and must confront Judaism.  A second is the fact that this is a
state that has to confront a situation of two peoples claiming
the same land, each of whose claims are fundamentally exclusive,
even if one people, and now maybe both have reached a position
where most of them recognize their inability to carry out that
fundamentally exclusivist claim in practice.  I would like to
discuss both these sets of contradictions and then talk about
ways in which we might start an exploration as to how to build a
political philosophy to deal with them.</p><p align="justify">

With regard to the normal contradictions, I think the twentieth
century has learned a lesson that the nineteenth century taught
us, that every society is ultimately a civil society.  The
nineteenth century view that society was the comprehensive
category, somehow embracing government but able to exist apart
from it or beyond its scope, has turned out to be incorrect.
Today, we are more prepared to go back to pre-nineteenth century
theories of one kind or another -- that society is inevitably a
polity or a civil society.  Here I make a distinction because in
polities, in the original sense of the term, there was no
distinction between the governmental and the social, that a
polity was a seamless web, at least not in classic Greek thought.
(Whether that was the case in practice in certain Greek cities is
a different question.)  If we take the seventeenth and eighteenth
century view, society is civil society, namely every society is
established through one or more political compacts which provide
for a governmental dimension, but also guarantee space for
individuals to be free of government, for a private dimension
within the framework of civil society, which it seems to me is
one of the major revolutions of of modern political thought.</p><p align="justify">

In the nineteenth century the stylish ideologies took matters a
step further away from the polity.  Every major ideology of the
nineteenth century not only rejected the notion that society had
to be a polity but also that it even had to be civil society.
Marxism saw government -- the state -- as something that would
wither away once the revolution of the proletariat was
accomplished. Anarchism saw the state as immediately bad, as
inevitably bad, because it interfered with the true goodness of
human nature and prevented that true goodness from coming out.
Laissez-faire saw in the work of the market, a replacement for
government.  Every single ideology of significance in the
nineteenth century can be said to have looked to the automatic
society, to a society that would function without coercive
institutions of government.  All of those ideologies have failed
as satisfactory vehicles for establishing political order and
safety, security and rights, so that we have to agree on the need
for government.</p><p align="justify">

There is a special problem here with regard to dealing with the
normal contradictions and that is, what understanding of
democracy do we use?  I would suggest that there are basically
three understandings of democracy that are prevalent in the
contemporary world.  One is collectivist democracy.  Lately,
since in the 1960s it has been called participatory democracy.
Everybody sits around and collectively reaches some kind of a
consensus in decision-making.  In Eretz Israel it was certainly a
very prominent aspect of the original kvutzot and kibbutzim.  
</p><p align="justify">
The second, I would suggest, is Jacobin democracy which is
essentially an application of Rousseauian concepts of the general
will with the added dimension that if the general will is not to
be determined by 50 percent plus one vote -- and the reason it
cannot be is that a state cannot rely upon popular majorities to
be right -- then the state needs a guiding elite that will define
the general will, which is the position the original Jacobins
took during the French revolution. As Talmon and others have
appropriately and effectively argued, this view is the basis for
at least the structures of totalitarian states.  
</p><p align="justify">
The third is what I would call federal democracy, using federal
not only in its eighteenth century sense but in its seventeenth
century sense of covenant, let us say, a democracy which is
established by covenant or compact that expresses itself through
the diffusion of power, through an understanding that there is no
general will or permanent majority in civil society but, rather,
that all members of the body politic have interests and concerns
which converge and diverge at different times under different
conditions, so that, in any polity, everybody is part of many
minorities for some purposes and majorities for others.  The
latter are essentially coalitions of minorities that change from
time to time, fairly frequently on some issues, and so,
therefore, any efforts to make decisions on a collectivist basis
or through a guiding elite are bound to injure the democratic
rights of some significant segment of the population.  I do not
think that we articulate these different understandings of
democracy sufficiently in our discussions of democracy; we
usually leave these as unstated premises which is why we
generally talk past each other on these matters.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>              The Special Contradictions of Israel
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Turning now to the special contradictions of Israel, let me start
with the problems of state, democracy, Jews and Judaism.  It
seems to me that the most concrete and pressing questions
confronting us are: What should be the status quo or should there
be a status quo?  What is the relationship between individual
liberty and the desire to maintain a Jewish content in the public
space of the state?  What about the Law of Return as a barrier to
being a fully democratic state?  
</p><p align="justify">
The real problem with these problems is not the fact of a Jewish
state but the lack of consensus within the Jewish state as to
what it should be. Were this a state in which there were a
substantial consensus about what constitutes Judaism, I do not
think we would have problems of Judaism and democracy.  Indeed, I
think that we would not have any insurmountable problems in
reconciling the governance of the state and <I>halakhah.</I>  There are
people of impeccable <I>halakhic</I> credentials -- for example Rabbi
Chaim Hirschenson, who, on paper, did a fine job of reconciling a
modern state with a fully, one might even say ultra-Orthodox (at
least for his time) understanding of <I>halakhah</I> over 60 years ago.
</p><p align="justify">
The problem is that there is no agreement on the need to do so or
the desirability of doing so.  Even the Law of Return, as I
suggested last time, is not a problem, per se.  Every state has
certain privileged people, born outside of its boundaries, who
are entitled to automatic citizenship.  For example, the children
of two American citizens born outside of the United States are
entitled to American passports and can go to the United States
freely while their peers, who were born in the same place at the
same time but do not have that fortunate or unfortunate
advantage, cannot do so.  France holds to the principle that one
can never cease to be a French citizen or a national.  Frenchmen
born outside of France even elect two Senators to the French
national legislature.  Other states take the same position.  So
this problem, in essence, is the lack of consensus with regard to
the need or the desirability of such an arrangement for Jews as
Jews.</p><p align="justify">

Much the same thing is true with regard to the question of
democracy and the two peoples in the land.  Here I think the lack
of consensus is based upon a failure of will in two groups.  Let
me make it clear; I do not refer to the lack of consensus between
Jews and Arabs -- the consensus between Jews and Arabs has not
even begun to form -- but to the lack of consensus within Israel
with regard to what position we should take vis-a-vis the Arabs,
the Palestinians, the other people in the land.  This lack of
consensus is a relatively new thing.  I think that there was a
far greater consensus with regard to what to do with the Arab
inhabitants of the land before 1967 than subsequently.  The
consensus underwent several changes over the years but the fact
that those who were outside the consensus, such as Brit Shalom
and, at certain times, Hashomer Hatzair, were so clearly so, was
a sign that the consensus was very broad indeed.  This consensus
was shattered after the 1967 war, certainly since 1973.  In my
opinion, this is because of a failure of will in two groups.  I
use the phrase "failure of will" deliberately; even though it is
a very problematic term.</p><p align="justify">

I think that there is a failure of will on the part of what we
generally think of as a segment of the generation of 1948 who,
compared to where their fathers and mothers stood on these
issues, see in the protracted conflict something that is to be
very much feared for a whole host of reasons. My concern here is
not whether they are right or wrong, but the fact of the matter
is that their parents' generation was prepared to enter into an
intense and protracted conflict to achieve their Zionist vision
while they are not.</p><p align="justify">

I think the other group is a segment of the post-1967 generation
which had great expectations in the aftermath of the 1967 war,
hopes that were disappointed by a reality which we helped forge.
They are disappointed in that reality and are undergoing the same
kind of failure of will.
</p><p align="justify">
On the other hand there may be a lack of adaptation on the part
of those who may have the will or believe they have the will to
continue the conflict but who have not adapted to the changed
situations that have occurred.  Again, whatever is correct, and I
do not know that we know which is correct, this leads to a
breakdown in the consensus within the Jewish population of Israel
with regard to how to proceed.
</p><p align="justify">
Once, at a conference with Palestinians, I watched a group of
that part of the generation of '48 which has taken the lead in
the peace movement, reject a Sephardi who was clearly of their
political orientation on that issue.  They literally would not
talk with him. They would huddle by themselves and talk about
this and that and the other thing, but they were more prepared to
talk with the Ashkenazic woman from Gush Emunim than they were to
talk with him, even though he was absolutely within their ranks.
I mentioned this to her at a certain point and she said, "Yes,
don't you understand?  Why do they want what they want with
regard to peace? They are dreaming of what they remember of
Israel in their childhood and youth and they figure first we will
settle with the Arabs by giving back the territories through
partition so we will get rid of them.  We will only have the ones
in the Galil.  We cannot help that, but they are a small
minority.  Then they can get rid of the Orthodox because that is
Gush Emunim -- after all, all Orthodox have to be Gush Emunims.
They can get rid of them if they cut them off.  And then they can
get rid of the Sephardim. Then the country will be really nice,
right?  Only the nice people will be there."</p><p align="justify">

Now she was Gush Emunim, I am not Gush Emunim and I do not share
her views about Gush Emunim, but I happen to think in this case
she was right about these particular people.  Why?  Because I saw
their behavior in which it was not an ideological category at
all, which was perfectly reasonable.  Of course, we may find
similar phenomena on the other side, although I do not have any
good examples of it.
</p><p align="justify">
It is unquestionably harder to reconcile the two peoples, but I
do not think that it is impossible if there were a sufficient
will to do so on both sides. Basically, I do not think that
Israelis, whatever side of the peace question they are on, really
want to be reconciled with Arabs.  I think they want peace with
them based upon separation in one way or another.  There are
those who want to achieve separation by returning to the pre-1967
borders or something like that, and those who want separation by
hoping somehow for emigration of the Arabs, or transfer.  The
fight is over that issue, but the desire for separation I think
is as strong in both quarters.  By the way, I think the desire on
the part of the Arabs for the removal of the Jews is, if
anything, even stronger.  So that, again, it is not the
impossibility of doing so from some objective point of view, it
is the lack of a will to do so.
</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>      The Partial Breakdown of the Present Social Contract
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

This now brings me back to the question of internal Israeli
society again -- to the present social contract and why it seems
to be breaking down -- perhaps not entirely, but at least
partially.  What did the original social contract of 1948 include
of particular relevance to us here?  I think we can talk about
five elements that are particularly relevant:
</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">
The status quo in sharing public space -- that is to say, the
status quo agreement that was established really had to do with
sharing public space between Orthodox and non-Orthodox.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Part of the social contract was not insisting upon a religious
or <I>halakhic</I> definition of who is a Jew, but developing a
quasi-secular one that is built upon certain initial premises
associated with the religious understanding.
</p><LI><p align="justify">
 The agreement that, with the exception of certain yeshiva
students, no matter how one views the other issues in society,
one carries out one's security obligations.  One serves in the
military; one participates in the defense of the country.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The agreement that, even where different visions are involved,
there should be a consociational sharing in institutions.  The
Zionist idea itself increasingly became the faith of the fathers
but remained a faith.  This essentially meant that the system of
proportionality would be maintained.  Each different movement
with its ideology and constituencies would fight in the accepted,
agreed-upon political arenas, would win whatever percentage of
public support it could in those arenas, would enter into
coalitions or not accordingly, and would, in return, get some
equivalent share of the common enterprise. That is the basis of
consociational sharing.
</p><LI><p align="justify">
 There was a general agreement that we would recall the Second
Commonwealth and its failures and that we would not repeat the
same mistakes.  Ben-Gurion and Begin both drew out special
lessons from that experience.  Ben-Gurion emphasized the lesson
that Israel could not afford to get into conflict with the major
power in whose sphere of influence it was, the way ancient Judea
came into conflict with Rome.  Begin emphasized a different
lesson, namely that Jews could not allow themselves to fall into
civil war. Both these lessons, I think, were accepted by all
parties, as witnessed by the decision on the part of the Israeli
parties then of the left to ally Israel with the United States,
not entirely a voluntary decision but still there were choices
made, and Begin's decision first not to fire back during the
Altelena affair and then to allow the Etzel to be disbanded and
to join in the normal political processes, even though for him,
at any rate, and his colleagues there was great provocation and
he was under some pressure not to do so.</p></ol><p align="justify">

Now what has happened with this original social contract of 1948.
With regard to the status quo and sharing public space, I think
there has been increasing rejection in two directions.  One is
the rejection by the ultra-Orthodox.  They now want what I would
suggest is not so much the sharing of public space as a new
status quo based upon what our colleague, Mordechai Rotenberg,
and others, have described, drawing from a traditional idea, as
the Issachar-Zebulon transfer.  In other words they see
themselves as the guardians of Torah which keeps Israel alive and
they think that the rest of the state should simply support them,
their institutions, and their people.  On that basis, I believe
they are prepared (except for the most extremist among them) to
maintain civil peace provided there is unrestricted support of
their institutions.  Otherwise sharing public space involves too
many compromises and they are no longer prepared to accept that.
I will come back to why that makes a difference now when it did
not make a difference in 1948, since they probably did not see
matters much differently 40 years ago.
</p><p align="justify">
On the other side is the rejection of the old status quo by a new
generation of hedonistic individualists.  Characteristic of the
original generation of 1948 that accepted the status quo in this
area was that they were more militantly secular than most of the
people who oppose it today.  I am not talking about the few
active secularists; I mean the general population.  They were
more militantly secular but they also had two things.  They had a
deeper understanding of what the sharing of public space was
about because they knew what being Jewish was about even if they
had rejected the religious dimension of Judaism, and second, they
had an appreciation for the some of the ancillary values, not the
religious values, but the ancillary values of a <I>yom menucha</I> (day
of rest) and of <I>hagim</I> (the cycle of Jewish holidays) that
reflected the tradition.  They were, indeed, in many cases
interested in maintaining both by pouring new wine into old
bottles.
</p><p align="justify">
The present generation is probably much less secularist.  If you
polled them, most of them would probably even own up to a belief
in God.  But they want their conveniences like most everybody
else in the Western world these days.  And if they want to have
their conveniences on Shabbatot and hagim and so forth, they do
not want to be restricted because of some status quo that
requires them to share public space in a way that those
conveniences are somehow limited or made unattainable.  This is a
more serious assult on the status quo, one which, in my opinion,
almost inevitably disrupts the previous arrangements.  The only
comparison I can think of, but I am sure there are others, is
what happened in those Western societies at the end of the
nineteenth century where Protestantism had a very strong hold and
required closing down commercial and recreational activities for
the Lord's Day -- "blue laws," as they were called in the United
States.  When there was no longer a consensus around those laws
-- and most of the time they were not even enacted into law until
there was no longer a consensus to sustain them on a voluntary
basis -- then the Protestant fundamentalists managed to secure
such legislation in a period of transition.  It never worked,
because unless there is a consensus, one cannot successfully
impose such things by law in a free society.
</p><p align="justify">
The second element in the breakdown is the ultra-Orthodox attack
in the who is a Jew issue.  In fact this was an attack that in
its serious form was generated from outside the state. Those
inside the state who originally generated this attack, in my
opinion, did it as a smokescreen to get more money in the
Issachar-Zebulon transfer.  But when the Lubavitcher Rebbe
started, he had a different agenda in mind.  What is important
about this, again, is not the issue itself but the shifting
balance of energy in the Jewish people which, it seems to me, is
a very serious issue; that with the demise of energetic Zionism,
ideological energy has been shifted to fundamentalist Orthodoxy
as ideological energy in much of the world has flowed to
fundamentalist religion in general in the last decade or so. This
is not necessarily an inevitable or enduring phenomenon, but for
the moment almost the only people who have ideological energy in
Jewish life today are the fundamentalists.</p><p align="justify">

Second, there is demographic energy.  This is even more apparent
in Jewish life than the ideological question.  The only people
who are reproducing themselves today in substantial numbers are
the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox.  In the diaspora there is less
than zero population growth and while in non-Orthodox Israel
there still is some population growth, it does not compare.  This
kind of energy also effects the tide of events.  As we know, most
human events are not shaped by vast majorities that are
relatively inert, but by energetic minorities.  And this is a
very energetic minority and it is energetic on two of the most
crucial fronts of Jewish life at any time, namely the ideological
and the demographic.  So it means something when the assault on
the status quo comes from that quarter.</p><p align="justify">

Third, there is a growing refusal of a still fringe but perhaps a
portentious fringe group to carry out their security obligations
because of their opposition to certain government policies as in
the case of Yesh Gvul.  This has not gone nearly as far as have
the actions of the ultra-Orthodox in breaking down the status
quo.  I think that there is still a very strong consensus with
regard to carrying out security obligations, but there is no
question that it is not the essentially universal consensus that
we had come to know.
</p><p align="justify">
Fourth, there is a great decline in the consociational bridge
that provided a linkage between the contentious groups that
comprised the Zionist movement and later the State of Israel.
This has led to an intensification of the confrontation in the
realm of ideas.  The consociational bridge could maintain itself
as long as most people in the country fit into one or another of
the camps and parties that comprised the consociational system.
Today almost the only people who find themselves at ease in this
kind of framework are the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox, the
religious camp in its broadest sense, and perhaps some elements
of the far left and far right and I am not even sure about them.
For most Israelis today, however they vote, Labor or Likud, they
do not identify themselves heart and soul with some camp.  They
are not tied into the institutions of that camp except in a
residual way.  They do not live their lives within the framework
of that camp as had been the case up until the mid to late 1960s.
And therefore the consociational bridge is no longer available,
while at the same time the willingness to share, to communicate
in the realm of ideas, remains strong.</p><p align="justify">

Finally, the collective recollection of the failures of the
Second Commonwealth is still holding. To me it is extremely
significant with regard to the social contract that holds Israel
together that at those moments when violent confrontation has
crossed certain red lines, it has immediately ceased and pulled
back.  After the murder of Emil Grunsweig, the demonstrations
stopped almost immediately on both sides.  When the burning of
bus stops led to violence against synagogues and yeshivot, again
there was a full stop.  Everybody stopped, even the people we
would think of as being outside the consensus, their leaders
stopped them.  These to me are signs of this collective memory,
so to speak, and it is still holding.</p><p align="justify">

Now this means that there are still some elements of the status
quo, of the original social contract, that are holding, but there
are so many that are not that the others are likely to erode if
there is not a restoration or a renegotiation of the social
contract.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                Toward a Covenant of Civil Peace
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Let me say a final word about dealing with the contradictions.
Again, let me reiterate that every proper democratic state rests
upon the consent of its citizens, not as an armistice between
enemies but as an agreement among partners in a common project.
If it is really an armistice between enemies, then it may suffice
to keep a certain modicum of civil peace but it certainly cannot
function as a civil society. A social contract in this sense is a
minimum.  Appropriately a society would be based on a mutual
covenant which is much more than a social contract.</p><p align="justify">

A contract is properly understood as an agreement entered into by
two or more parties primarily for the individual benefit of each
and only secondarily for their mutual benefit. That is the
difference between a compact and a covenant.  A social contract
is something that is useful because there is an individual
benefit in maintaining sufficient civil peace to protect at the
very least one's life and maybe beyond that one's liberty, one's
property, one's pursuit of happiness, the phrases that we are
used to in describing such matters.  But it is a minimalist
requirement, designed primarily for individual benefit and only
secondarily for mutual benefit.
</p><p align="justify">
Contracts are written the way they are, crossing every "t" and
dotting every "i," because it is legitimate for each side to try
to interpret the contract to get the maximum for himself and to
give the minimum to the other side.  It may not be the best, most
self-interested policy, but it certainly is possible, and because
it is possible, that is why contracts are written that way as
distinct from covenants or compacts in which there is a dimension
of <I>hesed</I>, of mutual obligation and responsiveness that goes
beyond the letter of the past.  In any covenant, it is expected
that the partners have a goal of mutual benefit that is at least
as high if not a higher priority than that of individual benefit,
and which requires everybody to act with a certain openness and
forthcomingness in such matters.  Every civil society that is
based upon a compact or a covenant, as distinct from a contract,
has some term, frequently a legal principle -- comity, for
example, in the Anglo-Saxon world -- that embodies this
requirement that people behave in such a way.  Otherwise the
compact or the covenant cannot hold.</p><p align="justify">

In this connection, I think that there is an advantage in turning
to perhaps the most hard-headed, hard-nosed philosopher of them
all, Thomas Hobbes, as a starting point.  In the Israeli
situation, Hobbes has the virtue of starting from an utterly
secular, a radically secular beginning, though he ends up
acknowledging if not requiring a religious understanding of what
he proposes as well.  Sharting from that utterly secular
grounding, he makes a powerful arguement for a certain kind of
political covenant which is designed to protect life and to make
civil society possible.  Without accepting his institutional
solution as to how this covenant should be implemented, it is
useful to take another look at the fifteen natural laws or
fundamental covenants that from his covenant of civil peace
offers a starting point for serious discussion in any civil
society of how to create the kind of compact or covenant
necessary to make it work.  They are as follows: 
</p><p align="justify">
Hobbes' list of covenants:</p><p align="justify">
<ol><LI> To seek peace, and follow it.<BR>

<LI> By all means we can, to defend ourselves.<BR>

<LI> That every man strive to accommodate himself to the rest.<BR>

<LI> That upon caution of the future time, a man ought to pardon
   the offences past of them that repenting, desire it.<BR>

<LI> That in revenges, men look not at the greatness of the evil
   past, but the greatness of the good to follow.<BR>

<LI>That no man by deed, work, countenance, or gesture, declare
   hatred or contempt of another.<BR>

<LI> That every man acknowledge another for his equal by nature.<BR>

<LI> That at the entrances into conditions of peace, no man
    require to reserve to himself any right which he is not
    content should be reserved to every one of the rest.<BR>

<LI> If a man be trusted to judge between man and man, that he
    deal equally between them.<BR>

<LI>That such things as cannot be divided, be enjoyed in common,
    if it can be; and if the quality of the thing permit, without
    stint; otherwise proportionably to the number of them that
    have right.<BR>

<LI> That the entire right; or else, making the use alternate, the
    first possession be determined by lot.<BR>

<LI>That all men that mediate peace, be allowed safe conduct.<BR>

<LI>That they that are at controversy, submit their right to the
    judgement of an arbitrator.</ol></p><p align="justify">

These are all basic laws for civil peace. In my opinion it would
advance our discussion a great deal if we were to take these and
focus on them as the basis for thinking in more practical or more
immediate philosophic terms about our practical and immediate
situation.
</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>What Can Philosophy Contribute?
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

EF: You have given a gripping account of Israel's social contract
and a rather depressing view that it is breaking down.  Here we
are philosophers.  Is there anything we can do about it?  I think
this is a terrible century for philosophers because ideologies,
including those of the coarsest kind, are thrown around all about
the place and assume philsophy. You have here a very hard-headed
account of the fact that society involves power and there is just
and unjust power.  For instance, you could get all sorts of
people saying you cannot make that distinction, you cannot make
any distinctions but ideological onees. You can burn university
buildings of the establishment if you had a good ideology behind
it and you can do anything you like.  You can certainly seek
peace.  You can shoot people at random, provided ideologically
you are supported.  You find people celebrating terrorists of all
varieties.  You find people saying "one man's freedom fighter is
another man's terrorist" and vice versa. There is a universal
relativism on the part of the nice people, namely the liberals,
that is opening the door for terrorists and the PLO.  You,
yourself, mentioned the new fundamentalists.  There are
fundamentalists not only on the right, but also fundamentalists
of the left.  We live in a terrible century and I would think
that philosophy can make some distinctions and bring back to
respectibility certain things which in more decent times were
taken for granted, such as the example I have given.  Is this
possible?  This is a general question; it is also a particular
question.
</p><p align="justify">
DJE: I think it is something that must be tried.  In a sense,
that is what we have tried to do here. I am not sure we will be
able to give the judgement as to whether it is possible or not.
This is a terrible century.  At the same time, it certainly is
not the only terrible century in history.  It also happens to be
the only century we who are sitting here have.  Since I believe
that historical centuries end something like ten to fifteen years
into the chronological century, I think we have another 20-25
years of this century, for better or for worse.  Some of us will
still be actively contributing even after that, but for the
moment, at any rate, it is the only century we have.</p><p align="justify">

One of the things that attracted me to Hobbes years ago, and
brought me back to him in this case, was that Hobbes was
confronted by a society torn by civil war. He was writing
specifically for an England torn by civil war and ideological
civil war as distinct from earlier civil wars in English history
which were contests between different contenders for the throne
or maybe between Normans and Saxons, or similar parties.
Fortunately, we have not quite sunk to the level of civil war.
Still, this was an ideological civil war in which precisely the
kind of breakdowns that we have been talking about, that I tried
to lay out briefly this afternoon, had gone beyond even the
minimum maintenance of the armistice and had led to a shooting,
fighting war between Puritans and Royalists.  
</p><p align="justify">
That may suggest something about the possibility of philosophy,
Emil, it may be the worst answer to your question that I can
possibly give, that the impossibility of philosophy to do
something about such things is the reality.  But maybe subsequent
generations can learn from philosophy and maybe we can learn from
philosophy. After all we have not, thank God, nor do I see an
imminent danger of going into the kind of civil war that was true
of seventeenth century. Civil War or a War Between Two Peoples?</p><p align="justify">

Q: I would not define that as a civil war.  It was still between
two separate peoples.  </p><p align="justify">

DJE: The English saw themselves as one people.  The Puritans did
not fight to separate from England. They fought to gain control
of the government of their own land, as did the Royalists; that
is a civil war.</p><p align="justify">

I think that is one of the major special contradictions that we
have to deal with, that we are two peoples in one land, but the
war between us is not a civil war. The war between us is a war
between two peoples.  One of the worst problems that we could
confront, and we are moving toward it, is a situation that is
defined as "them or us" and "them or us" is not a civil war.</p><p align="justify">

Q: You said that the great majority, perhaps everybody, seeks
separation.  That may be true from the point of view of the 99
percent of the people who look for separation, but there is one
percent who are not interested in separation.</p><p align="justify">

DJE: They may look for accommodation, but I doubt whether they
are looking for accommodation in a way that would create one
people out of the two.  No doubt there are some people who seek
amalgamation, but I think there are very few on either side who
look for the convergence of one people through Jewish-Arab
amalgamation.</p><p align="justify">

Q: But you do consider the Arabs citizens of the State of Israel?</p><p align="justify">

DJE: Yes, of course, in the case of those Arabs who are, not the
Arabs who are not.  I consider them citizens of the State of
Israel, but I consider citizenship in the State of Israel to be
strictly a matter of citizenship -- that is to say, political,
civic, and social entitlement -- rather than a definition of
nationality.  I think that we still go by the Middle Eastern
definition of nationality that has been traditional in this
region until now.  It may be that in the future that nationality
will be defined by territory, but now it is defined by what
people one belongs to.  And that territorial boundaries change
all the time.  I looked into the question of boundaries and I
could not find any time in the history of this region when the
boundaries of political units in it survived for more than a
hundred years without changes.  Even on those rare occasions when
the imperial limits did not change, the boundaries within them
did.  Even if there was an empire that could impose order for the
length of time that the Ottoman Empire did, it changed the
boundaries of provinces and not just for administrative purposes.
It changed boundaries all the time, and most of the time there
were far more drastic changes than that.  
</p><p align="justify">
Nobody in his right mind living in this region over the last
three or four thousand years of recorded history would try to
define identity on the basis of territorial units.  Everybody
would be absolutely schizophrenic all the time, which is why this
is a region of peoples in which several peoples, sometimes as
equals but more often than not with dominant and subordinant
relationships, lived within the same territory, usually in highly
integrated proximity.  That is why partition has never been a
really good solution to conflicts in the Middle East unless it is
introduced on the basis of huge transfers of population -- as in
Cyprus in 1974 when the Turkish army invaded and seized its
northern 40 percent, expelled all the Greek Cypriots, and moved
in all the Turkish Cypriots.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>Is There a Serious Threat to Civil Peace Among Jews?</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

Q: Hobbes begins with "to seek peace and follow it." That follows
only after there is a consciousness of the inevitability of war,
the primary fact of war.  Now we do not have that among Jews
today.  That kind of a consciousness does not exist among Jews.
It is beginning to exist in the past few months between Jews and
Arabs, but I do not think that we have a fear of having a war
with the ultra-Orthodox or with the hedonistic secularists. </p><p align="justify">

DJE: First of all, Hobbes' call for civil peace is not only to
prevent war in the formal sense but to prevent anarchy or the law
of the jungle.  With regard to seeking peace and following it, I
agree with you that it assumes the threat of war in the Hobbesian
sense, let us not say the inevitability, but the threat of war.
I would say, I think there is that consciousness.  That is why I
emphasized the business of recalling what brought down the Second
Commonwealth because I think the fear of civil war among Jews, in
the Hobbesian sense, is an omnipresent element in the modern
Zionist enterprise. That is to say, not that it is going to break
out tomorrow, not that we are all sitting here in armed camps,
but that if we do not watch ourselves, we can easily degenerate
into a situation in which we have sinat hinam (senseless hatred)
and the kinds of conflicts that occurred between Zealots and
others in the Great Revolt and between Hasmonean kings and
Pharisees even earlier, and all that kind of thing.  That is a
very powerful element, not all that often articulated but very
much there, in shaping behavior in the modern State of Israel.
That is one of the reasons why, when I looked around at Israel's
reality, I came to Hobbes.

</p><BR>
<H3><CENTER>Even the Ultra-Orthodox Are Within the Consensus</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


My second point is that, in crucial ways, the ultra-Orthodox,
with the possible exception of the most extreme, have accepted
the social contract to a substantial extent in the other areas as
well.  With regard to the quasi-secular definition of who is a
Jew, yes, I think that, within very broad limits, they have
looked upon all of the secular Jews who come here, as long as
they do not overtly violate what they have defined as basic
<I>halakhic</I> precepts, they have accepted them as Jews and not simply
on the basis of <I>yisrael ata yisrael hu. </I> They certainly could
have further broadened their definition, but they have tacitly
accepted their Jewishness. For 30 some years in the state this
problem did not bother them and even now it only bothers them
with regard to recognition of non-Orthodox movements, which is a
political struggle of a different sort.  They have been prepared
to live with the reality of secular Jews as long as they do not
have to recognize secular Judaism. You cannot ask them to sign on
it, but they are prepared to live with it.  </p><p align="justify">

With regard to security needs, theirs is a mixed response.  They
have claimed the right to exempt yeshiva students from military
ervice since the founding of the state, but at that time the
issue involved some 400.  Only in the last few years has the
notion of actually trying to make sure that the vast majority of
their men go to yeshivot, been the case.  This has created a new
situation that was not true during most of the years of the
state.  They also did not have the expectations that the thing to
do was to spend x numbers of years in a kollel.  Even now, most
of them accept as part of the compromise that they go nominally
and briefly into the army after that point.  They do not deny
this.  Nor do they say that the others should not.
</p><p align="justify">
Q: Do the haredim share in the consociational institutions and
the consensus you have outlined?</p><p align="justify">

DJE: As far as sharing the consociational institutions, yes
indeed.  After all, Agudat Israel signed the Declaration of
Independence, a declaration of independence that from a religious
point of view has all sorts of problems.  Paul Eidelberg, who has
a very, shall we say, uncompromising view of such matters, wrote
an article in Judaism recently in which he makes a powerful
arguement for a fundamentalist position, why Israel's Declaration
of Independence is really traife from a fundamentalist viewpoint
that holds that the Jewish people was formed by God at Sinai. But
they signed it, they participated in the elections of the Yishuv
even earlier.  They draw themselves some lines, but basically
they participate in the institutions.  And I certainly think they
share the collective memory which is why, after all, they
stopped, even the ultra-ultras stopped or were brought by their
peers to stop when their violence against property began to lead
to potential violence against lives.  I certainly do not want to
apologize for or justify them but on these things they have
stayed within the consensus, even though, as I said, on the first
things it has been breaking down.  

</p><BR>
<H3><CENTER>Contract or Covenant?
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Q: Are you suggesting that a social contract is sufficient?  What
about the Hobbesian emphasis on covenant?  Should we not strive
for something more than a social contract?  What about the Arabs?</p><p align="justify">

DJE: I could not agree with you more; I meant the Hobbesian
natural laws with regard to both.  The reason that I focused on
the first is precisely because we have not really considered more
than a social contract and I am not sure to what extent we can
until there is sufficient consensus among the Jews.  It need not
be complete consensus, but a sufficient consensus.  Nor do I
believe that we must do the one while entirely ignoring the
other, only that the Hobbesian principles I presented are the
first basis, not necessarily the final one for dealing with the
contraditions that we confront.  Regarding the Arabs, at this
stage of the history of this region, we have two separate
covenants, as it were.  If we could achieve a social contract
between the two peoples, that would be a great achievement, even
if the two separate covenants remained.  I would be content if we
got out of this century with that.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3><CENTER>Jewish Fears and the Siege Mentality</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

Q: I am interested in the Second Commonwealth analogy.  What
about the Massada myth?
</p><p align="justify">
DJE: The importance of the Massada myth in Israeli life is a big
fiction developed by foreign journalists who were looking for an
explanation as to why suddenly Israelis were behaving the way
they were in the 1970s and 1980s.  Charles Leibman and Eliezer
Don-Yehiya have studied the Massada myth and they have studied it
quite well.  There was a period in the late 1920s and in the
1930s where there was an effort on the part of a certain segment
(or maybe two segments) of the Zionist movement to build a new
vision of Jewish military heroism around it.  That, of course,
does not comment at all on the problem that I raised regarding
the Second Commonwealth.  I mean, the Massada myth is not a
problem of civil war, it is a problem of fighting to the end and
then dying with your weapons in your hands.  It is vital to
recall that It was not a positive myth, it was a negative myth.
It was used as an example of how we are not going to repeat that
tragedy. Even at that, I do not believe that it had the power
that was later attributed to it as the "Massada complex" invented
by foreign journalists.
</p><p align="justify">
I must admit that I had not thought in terms of the importance of
avoiding the strife of the Second Commonwealth as a significant
factor here until it was called to my attention on a number of
occasions by a number of Israelis representing very different
political points of view and that is what triggered me to begin
to think about it. All I can say is that, short of far more
serious research than anybody has done on this, it remains on the
level of an hypothesis and no more, but it seems to me to hold
water.
</p><p align="justify">
I think the whole matter has to do with a general fear that Jews
have that basically we are not good at politics, that we are
always so contentious that we do not know how to govern
ourselves.  This appears to be a continuing doubt that gnaws at
Jews and I think it is really related to that, because the worst
manifestation of not being able to govern yourself is to do
stupid things when it comes to political decision-making and the
worst of the worst is when those stupid things lead to civil war.
</p><p align="justify">
EF: People whom we think of as potential friends are saying that
all these extreme right-wingers are the only obstacle to peace,
that they are leading Israel to self-destruction, I read this in
the newspapers.  You have to take into consideration the fact of
the siege, even if in the present war we are not shooting at each
other.  Our enemies know that if we get a vast anti-Israeli
propaganda in the few countries that are still halfway friendly
to us, that is part of the war.  I heard the view expressed that
if Abba Eban goes to America and expresses a different point of
view, he is acting as a traitor.  And Abba Eban is hardly
shooting at anybody.  One could also hear the opposite view
expressed that the head of the present government, in alienating
our best friends, is leading this country to self-destruction.
Now since the world is listening to what we are doing and since
presumably perhaps in the future what support we get from the
United States depends to a large extent on what public opinion
there, I think we can abstract from that.  So I think the
question of the fear as to whether we are able to govern
ourselves is a very real one.  Things really seem to be breaking
up.  
</p><p align="justify">
If I can add a point to this.  I often like to steal the thunder
of extreme leftists.  I think we should do that whenever we can.
Franz Fanon was an extreme leftist who wrote a book called The
Wretched of the Earth in which he made a point that he got
indirectly from Hegel, "so long as the colonized have no power,
they fight not against the colonizers but against each other."  I
apply this to the besieged, which is us.  So long as we cannot
break the siege, we fight each other -- of course to the great
relish of those who besiege us.  So I think one could say that
right now we really have a tremendous challenge to prove that we
can govern ourselves and at least not engage in a civil war when
we are besieged from the outside.  
</p><p align="justify">
Of course even while I am saying that, I know there are some
people who say "there is no siege from the outside, what are you
talking about?"  I have heard that view expressed.  Now we are
talking politics and we are talking political philosophy, and to
me it is hair-raising.  Professor Edward Alexander, a man who is
called an extreme right-winger, told me that in America right now
in a case where someone dared to quote the PLO national covenant
in criticizing the PLO, he was called a Fascist and a Nazi and so
on.  "How dare you quote that covenant when everybody knows the
PLO does not mean it."  Now things have reached a pretty pass
when these things are happening out there.  I think even a verbal
confrontation by ourselves could be construed as already part of
a civil war under these circumstances.  And I fully agree that
this civil war is something that must not be allowed to happen.
</p><p align="justify">
DJE: You may be right, if we are under siege in that sense.  I
guess one of the things that disturbs me a little bit about the
permises of your analysis is that I happend to think that to a
great extent we have broken the siege.  Maybe this is the
political scientist in me, rather than as a political
philosopher, because my assumption is not that the Arabs have
decided to love Israel's presence here anymore but that the Arab
states are really prepared for the indefinite future to accept
it. That is the difference between the present and the recent
past.  We are in a war with the Palestinians but that is
different from being besieged by the entire Arab world.  While
the war is not over, I think that we have broken that siege.  In
a sense it is almost part of Israel's expression of the Jewish
neurosis, in the way that many diaspora Jews see anti-Semites
under the bed.  Every time anything happens they expect a wave of
anti-Semitism.  Ours may be to exaggerate the degree to which we
continue to be besieged. Not that we were not for a long time; we
were.  I really do not think we are in a siege like that any
more.  In some respects, that is why what the Palestinians are
doing has a certain quality of desperation about it.  It may
work, but it has a certain quality of desperation about it
precisely because they have been deserted by those who were
conducting the siege and who made the siege possible.  If we do
stay with the view that we are totally besieged, then what you
say follows.  I guess I am prepared to risk that my analysis is
correct, partly to prevent our being torn apart and partly
because it is the only way we are going to have a chance to make
peace.  
</p><p align="justify">
Now again, maybe part of the Jewish political culture is to see
things very much in extremes.  I do not want to get into that
question but there are reasons to believe that Jews tend to
believe that either we are besieged or we are fully at peace --
peace in the full sense of shalom, real peace.  I do not believe
the matter is so simple, that life is either a question of siege
or of full peace.  I think we can be in a position where we have
to keep our powder dry, yet not be at a point where hostilities
are about to break out because it is in nobody's interest for
hostilities to break out.  In my opinion, to be at this point is
already breaking the siege.  In my opinion, would be more
effective in thinking about how to come to grips with the war
that we do have, which is with the Palestinians, if we understand
that it is not necessarily part of the larger siege at this
point.  It could become again.  It could easily lead to the
resumption of the siege because the Arab states could also be
faced with certain inevitabilities of not being able to act
differently than to go into a siege.  But right now I think that
they are looking for a way not to fall back into that situation.
That is why the Palestinians are desperate.  So I myself would
like to be able to approach the larger, the philosophic, question
from a somewhat different assessment of the reality than you
present.
</p><p align="justify">
Aviezer Kautsky: I also disagree with Professor Fackenheim from
another point of view.  In my personal opinion, the level of
loyalty and commitment of 98 percent of Israeli society to one
another is really unbelievable.  Let us take two extreme
examples.  For instance during the evacuation of Yamit there were
many people, including many soldiers, who completely opposed and
rejected the withdrawal, yet they obeyed the decision of the
legal government of Israel and they evacuated many families by
force against their convictions and will.  At the other extreme,
perhaps 45 percent or even 51 percent of the people objected to
the Lebanese War, yet only 147 behaved as many Americans during
Vietnam, and refused to serve.  We must remember that the
population is divided almost equally and each bloc is almost sure
that the policies of the other are going to destroy us, yet
despite this fact Israel's democratic procedures are working
well.  There has been no political murder, if I ignore the murder
of Emil Grunsweig which was committed by some poor, unbalanced
person, not by a political party, so I believe that the behavior
of the Israeli population is positive in an unexpected way.
</p><p align="justify">
Comment: Prof. Fackenheim introduced the term "siege," because it
is the use of the siege mentality that has to a large extent
cemented the nation.  I happen to agree with what Professor
Elazar just said.  Indeed, it is the growing perception that we
are no longer under siege to the extent that we were that
accounts for the fact that there are 147 people who did not go to
war in Lebanon.  In other words, it is precisely the diminution
of the feeling of being besieged that contributes to the
breakdown that we are talking about. Many social critics in
Israel say that the external threat has been manipulated by
several Israeli leaders in order to create cohesiveness within
Israeli society.  I do not know to what extent this is
empirically true, but it is a valid opinion which is very often
heard.</p><p align="justify">

Comment: Among the items that we have agreed to remember as part
of the social contract, like the Second Temple mistakes, I would
suggest that perhaps the Holocaust is part of the consciousness
of Israelis, that when you talk about siege mentality, it begins
to take on a dimension that otherwise it would not have.  When a
Jew with a consciousness of the Holocaust thinks that he is
besieged, it means something quite different than when the word
that appears in another context.</p><p align="justify">

Pinchas Peli: A siege can also be put by the world media.  It
does not have to be by soldiers along the border.  Anyone who
goes outside of Israel now will see that there is a concentrated
attack on Israel, not on certain actions of certain people.  So
the siege is still there.</p><p align="justify">

EF: I do not want to confuse siege with siege mentality.  I have
often been told that I have a Holocaust complex and I tell people
"you have a non-Holocaust complex."  So when I see the recent
report about the Syrian rearmament, it is absolutely frightening.
When you bear in mind that Syria is economically broke, that
means there must be support with Saudi Arabian money for what
they are doing.  Then there is Russia behind it.  I do not trust
Gorbachev's smile.  Then I think the worst of all -- what is
going to happen when Iran is going to win the war against Iraq
which seems almost inevitable.  That explosive fanaticism with "a
lust for Jerusalem," that is how he called it, I do not think the
siege is over.  After all that, and Pinchas rightly points out,
the determined attempt to alienate our one and only remaining
friend, namely the United States, that goes on every day in the
media, is a horrifying war and the attack is on Israel.  Now
almost anything goes.  You brought the Holocaust in.  There is a
certain restraint because of the Holocaust.  That restraint is
now gone. We are the new Nazis and we are oppressing the
Palestinians.  I just came back from Germany for a celebration,
forty years of the State of Israel, a hope fulfilled.  They
hardly dared to put out the posters.
</p><p align="justify">
DJE: This is not a very good time for public demonstrations of
sentiment for Israel.  On the other hand I think what has been
pretty clear around the world is that the governments are not
very hostile.  Governments have a union like everybody else and
the governments' union does not like civil uprisings from
anybody, even if they are justified in their eyes for other
reasons.  And the fact is that the leaders of the world
discreetly have supported Israel in subtle ways except when they
have to make public votes in the European Parliament or go on
television and the like, but in every other respect they have
been very moderate in deed -- because the governments' union does
not like to see things like the intifada, regardless of the
reasons. I think we have to develop a perspective on these
things.  It is our natural tendency to see ourselves as besieged
because after all it is not exactly a misperception to think that
we have been besieged very severely in the past, but I do not
think we are going to be able to make progress in the future
unless we are able to distinguish when the siege has been broken,
not forever maybe, but breaking a siege offers some opportunities
and the opportunities should be taken and tested.
</p><p align="justify">
Comment: In terms of the siege, I think the perception is the
thing, that is really the key.  When the social contract was
formed there was certainly an overwhelming perception, more than
a perception, a reality, that the siege was the number one
priority.  So people will more likely subjugate their individual
aims when they have an outside threat that has to be addressed
first. I think in order to go on, what we have to come up with is
a replacement for that one thing that was the binder for all the
different factions in the country then.  There never has been a
shared vision between all these factions.  When we talk about the
Zionist dream, there are so many different ideals of what that
Zionist dream is and what it should be. We have to focus on what
can be our goal, what can be the focus of the cohesion so that we
can build a contract to achieve it.

DJE: At one time we obviously did have the shared goal of coming
back to Eretz Israel.  That goal has only been partially
fulfilled. That this is so is an unbelievably great historic
failure of the Jewish people for which we will pay for centuries.
There has not been such a failure since the days of Ezra and
Nehemiah when the Jewish people last had such an opportunity.

It reminds me of the story of the very pious man who drowned in a
flood.  He went up to heaven and angrily confronted God, saying,
"all my life I was pious and when it came to the flood you did
not save my life!" And God said, "Wait, stop, go back and think,
tell me what happened there."  He said, "well, first the National
Guard came and said 'get out of here, there is going to be a
flood,' and I said 'I do not have to go, God will protect me.'
So I waited and the water came and covered the first floor.  I
went up to the second floor and I was confident in You.  And a
boat came along with some police in it and they said 'get in the
boat and we will take you away and we will save you.'  And I
said, 'I do not have to.  God will save me.'  So the boat went
off and the water rose higher and I finally climbed up to the
roof.  I got to the roof and I am sitting on the roof and a
helicopter came and the guys in the helicopter said to me, 'climb
up the ladder, get into the helicopter, you are going to be
drowned.'  I said to them, 'No, God will save me' and here You
failed me."  And God replied, "what are you, stupid?  First I
sent the police to get you out, then I sent the boat, then I sent
the helicopter.  That was enough."

It is the same thing with the Jewish people.  Three times we had
an opportunity, after the Balfour Declaration in 1917, when the
state was established in 1948, and again after 1967, and three
times we did not come and we are going to pay for that.  We are
paying for it right now quite heavily. Even though the return to
Zion was only partial, it ended as the possibility of a unifying
force for those who did come and especially for their children
because those of us who are here take it for granted.  We cannot
keep working on the steam of returning to the homeland.  We have
got to do something with it now that we are here.  
</p><p align="justify">
Comment: If you are talking about a social contract, you do not
need a unifying force.  All you need are people who want to live
here. I think the whole charm of a social contract is to
eliminate the discussion of a common vision.  Forget about a
state that has a vision.  We do not have a vision.  We are a
state that should serve its citizens with the basic minimums and
I think if you talk along those lines you stand a better chance
of developing a social contract.</p><p align="justify">

DJE: That is why social contracts are inadequate.  There are some
peoples, maybe the French (and even some of the French will
dispute this), certainly if you are Italian, it is sufficient to
be born Italian -- to have a social contract regarding whatever
services you get from the state which may not be all that much,
plus whatever you get from your surrounding environment, from
your family, from your social structure, and that is enough.  But
there are some peoples in this world, of whom the first and the
foremost are the Jews, for whom social contracts are not
sufficient.  Without a vision, we Jews have never been satisfied
and I cannot think that after all these years we are going to
change our character.  Therefore for us ultimately a social
contract can only achieve the Hobbesian principles of civil peace
but it cannot solve the larger problems that we face, but small
things first.</p><p align="justify">

Comment: But you contradict yourself because you look for a
social contract between people with different visions so you do
not give up the Zionist vision or your own type of the Zionist
vision. The social contract does not mean that you accept the
lowest common denominator; you have no vision anymore.</p><p align="justify">

Comment: Visions are just not the business of the state.  People
should have their own private visions. I think this is the way we
can get all the different elements together -- once Israelis
understand that the state is not in the business of fulfilling
their personal visions of what Jews ought to be or what a Jewish
state ought to be.</p><p align="justify">

Comment: That may be the subject of the next discussion.  How do
you get a state out of this kind of business.  We should start
with religion and separation of religion and state.
</p><p align="justify">

 DJE: I do not
believe that to be either possible or desirable for Israel or for
any community of Jews.  Jews cannot live without a collective
division.  They would just disappear.  If one chooses full
assimilaton as one's goal for the Jews, that will do it -- we can
see how it works for individual Jews who do not have any Jewish
vision.  Israel cannot survive either since Jews as individuals
tend to be energetic opportunity-seekers and, for most, the best
opportunities will be found elsewhere.  Moreover, why should
young Jews interrupt their lives for so much military service
when they can find what they want as individuals elsewhere
without the danger and the difficulty.  Without a shared vision
and a national consensus, I give Israel no more than a
generation.
</p><p align="justify">
Here we return to the advantage of the Hobbesian approach.
Hobbes' covenants of peace are fully secular, but as in the case
of Hobbes himself, they lead to something beyond the merely
secular.  Just as Leviathan is divided into parts, the first
entirely secular, one might say excruciatingly so, the second
points to a vision beyond that radical secularism.</p><p align="justify">

Can we find Israeli analogs to Hobbes' covenants of peace?  Of
course we can because they are universal.  A mere reading of them
suggests how the various individuals and groups in Israeli
society must seek peace and follow it, even as by all means we
can defend ourselves.  
</p><p align="justify">
A political philosophy requires theories of moral obligation,
justice, political association, and authority.  In this respect,
Hobbes' covenants of peace are a necessary but hardly sufficient
beginning, the consensual bedrock for political association, but
they do not address the problems of moral obligation, justice,
and authority.  Those need to be addressed from our own sources
-- the classic Jewish texts beginning with the Bible -- as well
as through the works of political philosophy.  Our own sources,
embodied in the Jewish political tradition, have a great deal to
say about all four of these dimensions of political life.  In our
discussions here we are beginning to draw closer to that
exploration.
