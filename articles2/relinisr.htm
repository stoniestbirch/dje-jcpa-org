                     <CENTER><H3> Israel as a Jewish State</H3></CENTER>
<p align="justify">
 It is widely accepted that Israel should be a Jewish state beyond
 mere demographic criteria.  That is to say, it must be more than a
 state of Jews.  In order to be a Jewish state, it must be built
 upon Jewish principles, including what are commonly considered to
 be Jewish religious principles. On the other hand, to pose this as
 a matter of religion and state is to adopt a terminology which is
 in itself problematic in Jewish tradition and to phrase the issue
 of the relationship somewhat falsely by putting it in Western
 Christian terms, whereby religion is the province of churches and
 clerics, and where any close relationship between religion and
 state would have to provide for some kind of formal recognition of
 the role of the church or its clerical leadership in the polity.
 Let us then try to approach the question from an indigenously
 Jewish perspective which, while it does not solve all the problems
 inherent in the issue by any means, offers us an alternate way to
 conceptualize the matter and which may help us to better confront
 it in reality.
</p>
<BR>
                         <CENTER><H3>The Three <I>Ketarim</I>
</H3></CENTER><p align="justify">
 The classic Jewish polity is organized around three domains of
 authoritative expression referred to in the tradition as the three
 <I>ketarim</I> (crowns), namely Torah, Malkhut (civil rule) and Kehunah
 (priesthood).  Traditionally each of these <I>ketarim</I> derives its
 authority directly from some combination of Divine and popular
 sanction. Even the Keter Torah, whose primary responsibility is to
 communicate the Divine will to the Jewish people, nevertheless can
 only function when its bearers are recognized as authoritative by
 the people.  Indeed, since the generation following the
 destruction of the Second Temple 1900 years ago, Jews do not even
 recognize voices from Heaven (Bat Kol) as <I>halakhically</I>
 authoritative.
</p><p align="justify">

 The Keter Malkhut, whose primary responsibility is to provide
 civil government for the people, exists by virtue of Divine
 authorization, although the people are empowered to choose their
 leaders within the limitations imposed by the Torah as
 constitution.  The Keter Kehunah is the Divinely authorized
 channel through which the people approach Heaven; in other words,
 the reverse of the Keter Torah.  As a channel, it was originally
 organized by Divine commandment, but it is given meaning only
 through public action.
</p><p align="justify">

 Over the generations, the bearers of each of the ketarim have
 changed.  The Keter Torah was originally in the hands of Moses as
 Eved Adonai, in essence the Lord's prime minister.  It then passed
 to the Nevi'im or prophets and later to the <I>hakhamim</I>, the sages of
 the Talmudic age, then to the <I>rabbanim</I>, rabbis.  Today, it is in
 the hands of the <I>poskim</I> (rabbinical decisors) and <I>dayanim</I> (judges)
 and, as a result of modernity, is shared by certain academics and
 intellectuals, de facto if not de jure.
</p><p align="justify">


 The Keter Malkhut has always been at least partially in the hands
 of the <I>nesi'im</I> (magistrates) and <I>zekenim</I> (elders) or their
 equivalent (e.g., <I>parnasim</I>, <I>ne'emanim</I>, -- trustees) in different
 periods.  It has also been shared at various times by the Eved
 Adonai (Moses and Joshua), the <I>shoftim</I> (judges -- from Othniel to
 Samuel), the <I>melekh</I> (king -- from Saul to the last Davidic monarch
 after the Babylonian exile), the <I>resh galuta</I> (exilarch), etc.  It
 has always been managed through a more complex system of offices
 than either of the other <I>ketarim</I>.
</p><p align="justify">

 The Keter Kehunah was initially in the hands of the <I>kohanim</I>
 (priests) and <I>levi'im</I> (levites), particularly the <I>kohen gadol</I>, and
 remains nominally in their hands to this day.  Initially the <I>kohen
 gadol </I>was supplemented by <I>kohanim</I> scattered throughout the people.
 Then the entire priesthood and levitical service was concentrated
 in the Temple in Jerusalem.  After the destruction of the Second
 Temple, new institutions developed to provide expression for the
 Keter Kehunah such as the <I>hazan</I> in Talmudic Babylonia and, more
 recently, the congregational rabbi who, de facto if not de jure,
 has acquired a role that falls more within the Keter Kehunah than
 the Keter Torah, however much most rabbis would prefer it to be
 otherwise. That, too, is a result of modern transformations in the
 expression of that <I>keter</I>.
</p><p align="justify">

 Israel as a Jewish polity already has manifestations of all three
 of these <I>ketarim</I>, carrying on the tasks of its governance.  From a
 traditional point of view, its <I>poskim</I> and <I>dayanim</I> continue to be
 the bearers of the Keter Torah, indeed in Israel more faithful to
 the Talmudic tradition than perhaps in any other Jewish community
 because of the scope of their jurisdiction.  (I exclude the small
 ultra-Orthodox fringe groups of the diaspora which tend to stand
 outside the comprehensive communities in their places of
 residence).  The civil organs of the state -- the Nasi, the
 Knesset and the Memshallah (government) -- continue the tradition
 of the Keter Malkhut even if only a minority of them see any
 connection between their role and the traditional constitution of
 the Jewish people.  This, indeed, is a problematic issue to which
 we shall return.  The Keter Kehunah is carried on not only in
 Israeli synagogues (indeed perhaps least there) but in such
 institutions as the local religious councils which essentially
 provide ritual services for those Jews who care to make use of
 them (and, at least in respect to burial, virtually all Jews in
 Israel do).  Thus, questions of religion, society and state in
 Israel should be considered within the context of this classic
 institutional framework and its contemporary Israeli expression.
</p><p align="justify">


 The first conclusion that we can come to is that, while Israel as
 a state is formally democratic and secular, providing equal
 support to all religions and no special recognition to any, as a
 polity it is indeed a Jewish one even if ambiguously at times and
 ambivalent about its Jewishness in various crucial ways.  It also
 means that the strengthening of the Jewish religious character of
 Israel as a polity need not, indeed should not, mean the
 strengthening of the power of rabbis -- that is to say, the power
 of the Keter Torah vis-a-vis the Keter Malkhut but rather, in
 making the institutions of the Keter Malkhut more consciously and
 deliberately Jewish and in raising the caliber of the institutions
 of the Keter Kehunah to satisfy the moral and esthetic as well as
 the ritual aspirations of Israel's Jews.
</p><p align="justify">


 In this respect, there has been some substantial progress since
 the establishment of the state.  As we all know, in 1948 Israel
 was dominated by the Labor camp whose socialist Zionism ranged
 from a-religious to anti-religious.  Labor's major relation to
 tradition was to try to revalue traditional symbols in such a way
 that they were emptied of their religious content and, relying on
 their historical dimensions, to give them a new ideological
 content in keeping with socialist Zionism.  The famous discussion
 over whether or not to include a reference to the deity in
 Israel's declaration of independence, which led to the compromise
 usage of Tzur Yisrael (the Rock of Israel - a traditional
 euphemism for God but, on its face, innocuous wording) was the
 apotheosis of this situation.
</p><p align="justify">


 By the end of the first generation of Israel's statehood, however,
 a very real change was manifest.  It, too, had its symbolic moment
 in the aftermath of the Entebbe raid in 1976 when the Knesset
 convened in special session to honor the heroes of that raid and
 give thanks for the deliverance of the hostages.  The late Israel
 Yeshayahu, then speaker of the Knesset, opened the session by
 ceremoniously placing a <I>kipa</I> upon his head and reading a Psalm.
</p><p align="justify">

 The election of the Begin government in 1977, which marked the
 beginning of the second generation of Israel's statehood,
 accelerated this trend.  Begin deliberately tried to introduce
 traditional Jewish religious expressions into the life of the
 state, albeit through a kind of civil religion rather than through
 traditional religion.  But, then, in many respects the very
 character of Judaism is that of a civil religion, linking
 religious and political matters, which is what makes this new
 trend not an exploitation of religious symbols for political
 purposes (whatever the political advantage may accrue to the
 present government for doing so) but an honest expression of the
 true Jewishness of the Jewish state.</p><BR>


            <CENTER><H3> The "Average" Non-Dati and Jewish Religion
</H3></CENTER>
<p align="justify">
 This brings us to the issue of the future relationship of the
 "average" non-dati Israeli to the values of Judaism to <I>mitzvot</I>,
 and to the authority of the Torah.  Israelis break down into
 roughly three groups: <I>dati</I> (Orthodox religious), <I>masorati
</I> (traditional), and <I>hiloni</I> (secular).  The <I>dati</I> camp is divided
 into <I>haredim</I> (ultra-Orthodox) of various shades and <I>datiim leumiim</I>
 (religious Zionists).  Altogether, they represent between a fifth
 and a quarter of the total population of Israel.  The <I>hiloniim</I>,
 who represent another fifth to a quarter of Israeli Jews, also
 divided into two rough groups -- those who are truly secular, not
 only rejecting belief but all forms of Jewish practice, and those
 who, while defining themselves as non-believers form a traditional
 perspective, observe Jewish religious customs to a greater or
 lesser degree, in some cases to quite a substantial degree,
 indeed.
</p><p align="justify">

 Today most Israelis, between 40 and 50 percent, define themselves
 as masortiim, which covers such a wide range of beliefs and
 practices that it is almost impossible of definition.  Some
 <I>masortiim</I> observe ritual <I>mitzvot</I> which we associate with Orthodoxy
 except that they may use their automobiles on Shabbat.  Others
 maintain relatively little in the way of ritual observance but see
 themselves as believers.  Indeed, what is common to virtually all
 <I>masortiim</I> is a strong commitment to belief in God, whether in a
 rational or superstitious way, or some combination of both, along
 with a concern for accepted traditional practices of the seasonal
 Jewish calendar (especially Sabbath, holy days, and festivals) and
 the customs (rites of passage) of the Jewish life cycle.
</p><p align="justify">
 Many of these <I>masortiim</I> are second generation Israelis in
 transition from <I>dati</I> backgrounds to <I>hiloni</I> practices, if not
 beliefs.  Unless something is done to give them a firm grounding
 for a proper religious expression of their Jewishness, in another
 generation or two most of them will be, for all intents and
 purposes, in the <I>hiloni </I>camp.  In this respect, they are like the
 second generation American Jews of a generation or two ago who
 formed the backbone of the Conservative movement, many of whose
 grandchildren today are either joining Reform temples or not
 affiliating at all.
</p><p align="justify">

 Whether or not this happens depends upon who will enunciate the
 values of Judaism in Israel and who will embody the authority of
 the Torah.  It seems that the overwhelming majority of the
 masortiim are Sephardic Jews, while religious values and authority
 in Israel are heavily in the hands of one segment of Ashkenazic
 Jewry, a segment which is poles apart from the Sephardim and the
 Sephardic attitude toward religious matters.  Moreover, the
 strength of the Ashkenazic religious establishment is such that
 those Sephardim who become <I>dati</I> are more likely to become
 Ashkenazified in their religious expression (because they are
 forced to do so) than to introduce the reasonableness and the
 openness of the Sephardic approach.  This is not the place to
 discuss why this is so.  In this writer's opinion, it is a tragedy
 of major proportions for the Jewish people and Judaism.
</p><p align="justify">

 Put simply, to the extent that Jewish religious values and
 authority are considered to be the province of the Ashkenazi
 religious leadership, they are perceived to be closed, unbending,
 and looking for ways to make Judaism a matter of following ritual
 humrot (more serious restrictions), rather than addressing the
 larger questions of life in a Jewish state from the perspective of
 all three ketarim.  While this is not necessarily an altogether
 true picture, it is the prevailing one and true enough.  As such,
 it is alienating except for those relatively few who are attracted
 by the kind of Orthodox fundamentalism implied in such an
 approach.
</p><p align="justify">

 As a result, the average Jew in Israel is quite ambivalent toward
 the religious dimensions of his tradition.  On one hand, he
 respects those dimensions, sees them as reflecting his basic
 beliefs, and wishes to identify with them through some measure of
 practice.  On the other hand, he finds so many of those who give
 them expression as being the people furthest removed from his
 values in almost every other sphere, whether in terms of the
 responsibilities of citizens within a democratic state, in respect
 for the political institutions of that state, or in their ability
 to address the serious problems of a contemporary Jewish society.
 The exceptions to this are to be found among the national
 religious youth who are indeed highly respected in Israel.  But at
 this particular moment in any case, they do not represent the
 cutting edge of those who seem to dominate the expression of Torah
 values and authority.
</p><p align="justify">

 From another perspective, it can be said that there is still a
 strong majority of Israelis who would like to have a positive
 relationship to the Torah and <I>mitzvot</I> but have not found a way to
 do so other than through a watered-down version of older
 traditional responses.  They have neither leaders to show them the
 way nor models to follow.  It also must be said that they are not
 working very hard to search for either.  Consequently, the future
 of Judaism in Israel could go either way.  There is every chance
 that the processes of secularization will continue unabated so
 that in several generations the vast majority of Israelis will
 indeed be Jews by virtue of their birth within a certain ethnic
 community only.  On the other hand, if appropriate leadership
 should emerge, there certainly is a fertile field for reversing
 that trend.</p><BR>


                       <CENTER><H3>The Israeli Rabbinate
</H3></CENTER>
<p align="justify">
 At the very least, Israel must produce an Orthodox rabbinate that
 is equipped to cope with the contemporary world, that is to say,
 rabbis who have a proper general as well as Jewish education and
 who know how to speak to the Israeli public.  Today, it is fair to
 say that there are no Orthodox rabbis being trained in Israel who
 meet this standard.  The Sephardic community has tried on several
 occasions to establish yeshivot which move in that direction but
 have been stymied by the adamant opposition of the <I>haredim</I> who
 have convinced even the Sephardic chief rabbis to stand aside
 from, if not actively oppose, such efforts.  This only compounds
 the tragedy of the denigration of the Sephardic approach to
 religion, since that approach was indigenous to traditional
 Sephardic rabbinical education and has been lost only as a result
 of Ashkenazification.  Consequently, it is fair to say that the
 Israeli rabbinate today is as close to utterly unequipped to deal
 with the problems described above as it could possibly be.  The
 American Orthodox experience may be of some help in changing that
 situation.
</p><BR>

                      <CENTER><H3> Education for Judaism
</H3></CENTER><p align="justify">
 As far as education is concerned, the Israeli <I>mamlakhti dati</I>
 (state religious) schools are losing students because they are
 closed to the <I>masortiim</I> for all intents and purposes, requiring
 them to lie about their observance if they are to send their
 children.  As it happens, many <I>masortiim</I> want their children to go
 to the <I>mamlakhti dati </I>schools but the segregationist aspects of
 the <I>dati </I>camp, which demand <I>dati</I> observance on the part of
 families before their children are brought in, has assured that
 non-<I>dati</I> children will be sent to the regular <I>mamlakhti</I> schools,
 which only accelerates the processes of their secularization.  It
 is hard to see the wisdom in this, although it does make for the
 development of a more doctrinally pure <I>dati </I>camp.  If the goal of
 the <I>dati</I> community is to maintain a small <I>shearith ha-pleta</I>
 (remnant), there is something to be said for that.  If its goal is
 to maintain Israel as a Jewish state then it is failing in its
 responsibility.
</p><p align="justify">

 Partly as a result of this, there has begun to emerge a
 <I>mamlakhti-masorati</I> (state traditional) school system branching off
 the regular <I>mamlakhti</I> schools.  Originally opposed by the <I>dati</I>
 camp, when Zevulun Hammer became education minister it was
 encouraged by him and has been by Yitzhak Navon, his successor.
 Hammer recognized that, given the aforementioned <I>dati</I> attitude,
 the <I>mamlakhti masorati </I>schools do not compete for students with
 the <I>mamlakhti dati</I> schools but with the fully secularized
 <I>mamlakhti</I> system.
</p><p align="justify">

 At present, there are still only a handful of masorati schools in
 Israel.  In each case, the organizers have been Conservative Jews
 from the United States who have settled in Israel.  Whether or not
 there will be a real Conservative movement in Israel depends upon
 the degree of success of these schools, something which the
 Conservative movement itself does not perceive.  If it did, it
 would be putting far greater resources into stimulating such
 schools than it presently is.
</p><BR>

                  <CENTER><H3> Non-Orthodox Judaism in Israel
</H3></CENTER><p align="justify">

 In Israel today there is essentially no discrimination against
 Reform and Conservative organization for purposes of worship or
 anything else.  There is only discrimination against Conservative
 and Reform rabbis, who are not recognized as rabbis.  However,
 since both movements have a strong clerical dimension, with the
 Conservative movement perhaps the most clerical movement in all of
 Jewish history (in the sense of entrusting virtually all
 leadership responsibilities to rabbis), their attention has been
 turned to securing recognition for their rabbis rather than being
 given to the training of a generation of Conservative <I>baalei-batim</I>
 (householders, usually referred to as lay people in the West).
</p><p align="justify">

 In Israel, where the daily expressions of religion are in the
 hands of <I>baalei-batim</I> and the rabbinate does not play a clerical
 role in the Western sense, this is, for them, a great mistake.
 Recently the Conservative movement established a rabbinical school
 in Israel, something which the Reform movement has already done.
 Both have failed to recognize that it is schools for the public
 which make movements where there is a Jewishly educated community
 and not rabbis on the American model to lead congregations.
</p><p align="justify">
 If the non-Orthodox movements foster schools, they will find a
 presence for themselves in Israel through the products of those
 schools who, incidentally, will in all likelihood have strong
 commitments to the values of Judaism, observance of <I>mitzvot</I>, and
 Torah as a source of authority.  If they do not, they will not,
 nor should they.  The last thing that Israel needs is the
 replication of the clericalism of the diaspora.  However necessary
 it may be there, where so many Jews are Jewishly illiterate even
 if they have strongly positive feelings toward Judaism, certainly
 it is not in place in Israel, where a Jew must make an effort to
 be Jewishly ignorant (even though so many are).
</p><BR>

                 <CENTER><H3>The Existence of Religious Parties
</H3></CENTER><p align="justify">
 If the questions of Torah authority, <I>hinukh</I>, and the rabbinate are
 questions of Keter Torah, then the question of the religious
 parties is a matter of the Keter Malkhut.  The religious parties
 in Israel are living evidence of the existence of Keter Malkhut as
 a separate phenomenon, each in its own way.  Both the Mafdal
 (National Religious Party) and Agudath Israel were formed to
 introduce a religious influence within the Keter Malkhut.  Tami,
 Morasha and Shas (Sephardic Torah Guardians), which splintered off
 from them, reflect the same interest.
</p><p align="justify">

 The NRP, as a Zionist party, embraced the fundamental principle of
 that Keter, namely that it was to be independent of the Keter
 Torah, and was established as an anti-clerical party from the
 first.  While in recent years certain members of the NRP have
 violated that anti-clerical posture, by and large the party has
 held to it, choosing as its leaders <I>dati</I> politicians rather than
 rabbis, however important and authoritative the latter might be in
 matters of the Keter Torah.  This, indeed, is a bedrock issue for
 them.  Tami has pursued the same course as, for the most part, has
 Morasha.
</p><p align="justify">

 Agudath Israel, on the other hand, is based on the principle that
 the relationship between the <I>ketarim</I> places the Keter Torah in a
 dominant position as expressed through its Moetzet Gedolei HaTorah
 (Council of Torah Greats).  But even it had to form itself as a
 political party in open recognition of the existence of a separate
 realm of the Keter Malkhut, a realm in which it needed to express
 itself in order to secure its political aims.  Shas, which broke
 off from Agudath Israel, has followed the same pattern,
 establishing its Moetzet Hakhmei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages).
</p><p align="justify">

 The foregoing empirical explanation for the existence of the
 religious parties should answer the question as to whether or not
 they will continue to exist in the affirmative, and may even
 answer the question as to whether or not that is a good thing.
 Given the understanding of the Jewish polity presented here, it is
 a well nigh inevitable thing.  In a Jewish state, the religious
 interests cannot abandon a whole <I>keter </I>and its entire arena,
 especially not the Keter Malkhut which, by virtue of statehood,
 became far more important than it ever was or could be in the
 diaspora.
</p><p align="justify">

 Statehood is, in many respects, Judaism's ultimate test.  The
 purpose of the establishment of the Jewish people, according to
 the Torah, was to single out one people to establish the holy
 commonwealth, which would be a model for all the peoples of the
 world, so as to hasten the redemption.  Thus the Torah is oriented
 toward polity-building, first and foremost, and the observance of
 the <I>mitzvot</I> cannot be complete except in a Jewish state.  In such
 a state, the Keter Malkhut will inevitably be strong.  Our
 tradition tells us that, sometimes in exaggerated ways in relation
 to the Davidic line.  Hence only those who have a truncated,
 highly spiritualized view of Judaism would reject an active
 religious presence in the political arena.  It is difficult to see
 how that presence could be manifested in Israel's political system
 other than through religious parties.  Needless to say, this
 explanation for religious parties presented on the highest plane
 is made even more real by the very practical reasons of securing
 legislative and financial support for religious institutions,
 needs, and expectations on a day-to-day basis.
</p><p align="justify">

 This does not mean that the future of the present religious
 parties is assured.  The future of Agudath Israel, which seemed
 secure until 1984, has been clouded by the breaking away of its
 Sephardic members to Shas, which took two seats from the Agudah
 and added two others.  Still, there is no reason to believe the
 party will abandon the political arena, given their successes
 within it since 1977.  If the Mafdal appears to be in greater
 jeopardy, it is partly because of the perhaps temporary emergence
 of other issues which have siphoned off some of its voters, plus
 the mistakes of its own leadership.  Still, it would be quite
 premature to assume that it will disintegrate unless the number of
 religious Jews drops so precipitously that the state is left to
 turn secular with a vengeance.  The parties that have splintered
 off from it may, indeed, find it advantageous to return to the NRP
 fold.
</p><BR>

                 <CENTER><H3>What About Religious Legislation?</H3></CENTER>

<p align="justify">
 One of the attributes of statehood is the restoration of the
 political arena as a major decision-making forum for matters of
 religious concern in the public domain.  Under such circumstances,
 as Charles Liebman has pointed out, it is inevitable that vital
 questions such as those surrounding religious standards will
 become political questions.  The fact that they have is another
 sign that, with all its ambiguities and ambivalences.  Israel is a
 Jewish state even in a traditional sense.
</p><p align="justify">

 On the other hand, to say that is not to suggest that every
 situation which in the abstract calls for religious legislation
 should lead to such legislation.  Before a decision is made, there
 are many considerations which come into play.  First and foremost
 is the issue of consequences.  For example, on the latest round of
 the "Who is a Jew?" issue, in the narrow sense the legislation is
 almost unexceptionable.  But in the larger sense of the
 preservation of the unity of the Jewish people in a situation in
 which the legislation will not do anything to change matters for
 the better and will only precipitate Jewish disunity, one would
 hardly consider it to be wise.  Prudence is also a Jewish value,
 one that the Jewish people have not always practiced.  Invariably,
 when it has not, disaster has ensued.
</p><p align="justify">

 Today, the struggle over religious legislation has been
 exacerbated because of a major shift that is taking place in the
 Israeli body politic.  Until recently, virtually all Israelis, no
 matter what their particular stance with regard to religious
 belief and practice, had grown up in traditional environments.
 Hence they had a certain understanding of and respect for
 tradition even if they no longer observed or even were militantly
 opposed to traditional Judaism.  Even many militant secularists
 could appreciate the quiet of an Israeli Shabbat.
</p><p align="justify">

 Today, paradoxically, at a time when militant secularism has
 greatly declined, a new generation has grwon up which, while it is
 more likely to acknowledge a belief in God and the appropriateness
 of some religious practices, has little or no personal experience
 with traditional Judaism.  It is a generation that fits into the
 contemporary world of consumerism in which convenience is a most
 important value.  They are the ones who want cinemas and places of
 entertainment to be open Friday night and Saturday and who would
 like to be able to do their shopping on their free day.  For them,
 these are matters of individual choice and they resent
 interference with their convenience.  Thus the consensus around
 certain publicly enforced standards of observance is rapidly
 breaking down.
</p><p align="justify">

 Not surprisingly, those in favor of maintaining such standards and
 who feel that the face of the society as a whole would be changed
 for the worst if matters are merely left to individual choice, now
 seek to reinforce the maintenance of those standards through
 appropriate legislation, which is opposed by the other side.  This
 situation is analogous to what occurred in the United States in
 the early 20th century.  During the 19th century, people of all
 levels of religious belief and practice accepted the Protestant
 norms in society with regard to such matters as Sunday observance,
 temperance, the content of the school curriculum, and the like.
 When that consensus broke down early in the 20th century,
 Protestant fundamentalists sought to restore it through
 legislation.  Even when they succeeded in getting such legislation
 enacted, as in the case of Prohibition or laws prohibiting the
 teaching of evolution in the schools, their victories were
 temporary because the majority of the population and the temper of
 the times was opposed to them.  The end result was to dismantle
 even the tradition of Sunday closing for the convenience of the
 new consumers.


</p><p align="justify">
 That is likely to be the fate of legislation which reflects the
 imposition of the will of the minority on the majority in Israel
 as well.  Hence those in favor of that legislation should think
 twice before pressing for it.  At the present time the majority is
 not opposed to the maintenance of public observance in the
 institutions of the state.  They want freedom of choice in other
 areas.  But if a <I>kulturkampf</I> is launched on the part of those
 seeking to maintain the status quo, it is likely that the majority
 will turn upon them even in those areas that still remain within
 the consensus.</p><BR>


                     <CENTER><H3>Religion and Public Issues
</H3></CENTER><p align="justify">

 What has been missing in Israel is a response on the part of the
 religious community to the current issues of Israel's foreign
 security and social agendas, out of their religious understanding.
 Not that religious groups have not expressed their opinions on
 these subjects, but their opinions have for the most part been
 drawn from their political ideologies rather than from the
 religious tradition, except for extremists who do not separate the
 two.
</p><p align="justify">

 It is imperative that the religious community respond to current
 issues of Israel's foreign, security, and social agendas out of
 their religious understanding.  Fortunately, the nature of serious
 Jewish thought on such subjects tends to be based on accumulated
 practical wisdom and not simply on the enunciation of ideal
 aspirations detached from reality.  So, for example, simple-minded
 peace rhetoric on one side or racist rhetoric on the other in the
 name of religion should be avoided, even though there will be
 those who obviously emphasize the religious value of peace or of
 Jewish self-maintenance above certain other religious values more
 than others would.
</p><p align="justify">

 Experience has taught us that there will be no single religious
 voice on any issue.  But the existence of religious voices is what
 makes religion meaningful in our times.  That is not to say that
 there is no danger in escalating public conflict over policy
 decisions in the name of religion.  Of course there is, since
 there is a certain apoditic character attached to all positions
 presented as religiously justified or, in some cases, mandated.
 That, indeed, can escalate tensions in any society and exacerbate
 cleavages.  Nevertheless, the alternative, namely silence on the
 part of those who claim to be religious with regard to the
 pressing issues of our time, is even worse.
</p><p align="justify">

 What it does mean, of course, is that a much greater share of
 religious resources must be devoted to exploring policy issues
 from a religious dimension.  This means, for example, religious
 support for policy studies institutes and think tanks whose
 members look seriously at the policy questions of the day in light
 of the Jewish political tradition, which in itself requires far
 more serious exploration than it has been given to date.</p><BR>


                 <CENTER><H3>The Mutual Influence of Israel<BR>
 and
                 Diaspora on Jewish Religious Life
</H3></CENTER>
<p align="justify">

 In this respect, the Israeli religious community also has much to
 contribute to the diaspora, particularly by reminding diaspora
 Jewry that the true expression of Judaism requires even religious
 Jews to confront the entire range of human concerns and not be
 content to maintain themselves on the basis of others, whether
 non-religious or non-Jewish, doing society's dirty work.  This is
 a crucially important contribution, one that is often overlooked
 even on the part of religious diaspora Jews who visit Israel but,
 like other Jews, still see Israel as a summer camp and not as a
 polity grappling with the full range of human problems and then
 some.
</p><p align="justify">


 Beyond that, there is no question that Israel is the principal
 center of Jewish scholarship and Jewish studies in all its forms
 and, hence, has so much to contribute to diaspora life.  With all
 the very welcome spread of Jewish studies on diaspora,
 particularly American campuses, there are few Jewish studies
 programs that reach a critical mass of scholars capable of
 matching an ordinary Israeli university and none able to provide
 the range and depth of coverage of Jewish civilization provided in
 any institution of higher education in Israel.  That is natural
 enough, since it would be as if American studies were covered with
 the same depth in some non-American university as they are at any
 university in the United States where American civilization is
 dominant.  That is one thing in Israel that has little if anything
 to do with religion per se.  Jewish studies abounds because Israel
 is a Jewish civilization.
</p><p align="justify">

 In the last analysis Israel and the diaspora need each other in
 the religious sphere as much as in any other.  Indeed, the problem
 is often whether or not the diaspora is capable of absorbing what
 Israel produces in those spheres.
</p><p align="justify">

 Conversely, when it comes to Jewish thought -- especially Jewish
 thought with regard to living intellectually in the contemporary
 world -- the diaspora religious leadership is far ahead of most of
 their Israeli counterparts.  They have something serious to
 contribute to Israel and should do so.  All forums which can be
 developed to encourage such exchanges are to be welcomed.
