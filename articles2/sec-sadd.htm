<p align="justify">
                         Abraham Feder's excellent article (21 December 1984)  in response
 to those of Shulamit Aloni (26 September 1984) and David Krivine
 (30 November 1984) has added depth and clarity to the debate on
 the role of religion in society, particularly in Israel, and how
 one's expectations from any religious system, including <I>halakhah</I>,
 need to be tempered by a more sophisticated understanding of the
 complexities of human nature.  Feder properly points out that
 religion is not only concerned with social justice but also is a
 response to the individual's deepest personal needs.  True
 religion must speak to both.  There is another dimension, however,
 what in my opinion needs to be added to the overall discussion
 with regard to religion, morality, and the State of Israel.
</p><p align="justify">


 The <I>halakhah</I> as we know it is a product of Pharisaic Judaism.
 While its origins as a corpus go back at least to the time of
 Ezra, 2500 years ago, and probably to Sinai as tradition has it,
 it took its definitive form in the generations immediately
 following the destruction of the Second Temple and was not fully
 accepted by Jews the world over as normative until the end of the
 3rd or early part of the 4th century of the common era.  From then
 until the modern epoch beginning in the 17th century and
 particularly from the late 18th, it was normative for all Jews
 except schismatics such as the Karaites.</p><p align="justify">


 During the modern epoch its dominance was broken but it was not
 until the 20th century that a majority of Jews ceased to live
 within the framework of <I>halakhic</I> Judaism.  Most simply drifted out
 of that framework.  Even those who went into non-Orthodox
 movements, with the exception of a few intellectual leaders, did
 so out of nostalgia, to retain some of the old customs and
 ceremonies, or out of the need for an acceptable form of Jewish
 identification in the modern diaspora.</p><p align="justify">


 Non-Orthodox palliatives worked in the diaspora but did not find
 an echo in Israel, where there soon developed a polarization
 between those who maintained <I>halakhah</I> in the Pharisaic manner as
 it had developed over the centuries, and those who saw a strictly
 secular political solution to the Jewish problem.  In some cases,
 this polarization was papered over by common Zionist aspirations
 which led to the development of the famous "status quo" and in
 other cases, where no suitable accommodation could be found, it
 led to confrontation.  In either case, it did not solve the Jewish
 problems of the majority of Israeli Jews: the quarter of the
 population that defines itself as secular and the growing share of
 the middle 50 percent who define themselves as traditional but who
 are rapidly losing their links with Jewish religious tradition as
 they drift out of older <I>halakhic</I> frameworks.</p><p align="justify">


 This might not have been a problem had the secular solutions
 advocated by the non-religious Zionists worked.  But it is clear
 to all by now, except a diehard few, that those secular utopias
 represent gods that failed.  Thus, even Shulamit Aloni, one of the
 most militant secularists in Israel, is involved in an effort to
 build a movement of "humanist Judaism" that will draw upon the
 moral dimensions of the Jewish tradition in order to cope with the
 moral and personal issues which religion addresses in all times
 and climes.</p><p align="justify">


 Shulamit Aloni appropriately turns to Israel's Declaration of
 Independence as one source in her search and relies on it and
 other products of the Zionist ideology to help her in her quest.
 In the past decade or so it has become apparent that, particularly
 for those Israelis outside of the religious camp, Zionism is the
 faith of their fathers, the only faith they know, hence the faith
 they turn to in hours of crisis.  We saw this most clearly at the
 time of the Yom Kippur War which revived Zionist sentiments across
 the spectrum of nonreligious Israeli groups.  We saw it in a
 different way in connection with the Lebanon war, when the
 morality of the war was attacked by its opponents on Zionist
 grounds and defended by its proponents on the same grounds, each
 emphasizing a different aspect of the Zionist heritage.</p><p align="justify">


 This is a common enough phenomenon, a variant of the "foxhole
 religion" experienced by soldiers in wartime.  To say this is not
 to dismiss it.  Quite to the contrary, reliance upon the faith of
 one's fathers is a natural human expression and the particular
 faith involved tells us a great deal about the aspirations of the
 people involved.
</p><p align="justify">

 In its own way, Zionism has become another branch of Judaism,
 parallel to Orthodoxy, Conservatism, Reform or Reconstructionism
 in the United States and other diaspora communities.  Albeit, like
 Communism, it is a secular rather than a theistic religion in its
 fundamentals (not that religious Zionists are not Zionists, but
 their Zionism plays a different role for them, representing as it
 were, an extension of a larger set of religious beliefs).  Zionism
 serves as the basis for the Jewish self-definition of a majority
 of the Jewish population of Israel just as Conservative and Reform
 Judaism serves a majority of the Jewish population in the United
 States. The one is primarily an Israeli phenomenon today with some
 diaspora outposts while the other is primarily American Jewish
 phenomena with outposts in Israel and other diaspora communities.
 As such, Zionism has its own rituals and symbols, which, because
 of its particular character have become part of the civil religion
 of Israel.</p><p align="justify">


 Like every religious movement, Zionism in its first stages was
 utterly messianic in that its proponents expected that it would
 achieve a rapid success which would in turn bring about the full
 achievement of its goals, namely, the redemption of the Jewish
 people in their own land through political means.  In fact,
 Zionism was successful enough to capture a major share of the
 Jewish people as its adherents and a central place for itself
 among modern Jewish institutions.  It did succeed magnificently in
 creating a Jewish state and transforming the Jewish people in the
 process, but like every other religious movement, its messianic
 expectations were not realized.</p><p align="justify">


 But there was another dimension to the Zionist experience. Zionism
 is a reflection of the rebirth of the classic partisan division
 within the Jewish people associated with statehood and now reborn
 along with the rebirth of Jewish political independence, and which
 are best known by the terms attached to them in the Second
 Commonwealth: Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes.  While these three
 parties (as they are commonly known) or camps acquired their
 respective identities under these names in the last era of the
 Second Commonwealth, in fact each camp can be traced back at least
 to the time of the Davidic monarchy when the Jewish people were
 divided into monarchists supporting the Davidic line, supporters
 of the prophetic school later identified with Elijah, and the
 Kenites, who continued to live as if in the Sinai wilderness for
 ideological reasons.  The revival of Jewish national existence in
 the land has led to a revival of those two of the three camps
 which had disappeared during the course of the long exile.
</p><p align="justify">

 There has been much talk about the normalization of the Jewish
 people in connection with the establishment of the State of
 Israel, all of which assumes a change in Jewish existence that
 will make the Jews "like all the nations."  It can be argued that
 normalization, for Jews, means the restoration of all three camps
 within Judaism and Jewish life.</p><p align="justify">


 The Sadducees were eminently the party of Jewish statehood in the
 sense that their Jewishness was principally expressed through the
 political institutions of a state and those religious institutions
 such as the priesthood and the Temple which were intimately bound
 up with statehood.  The Temple came into existence to emphasize
 the new statehood of David and Solomon and became the keystone of
 the renewed statehood of the Hasmoneans.  It acquired prominence
 in the halacha of the Pharisees only after it made no difference
 because the Temple itself was destroyed.</p><p align="justify">


 With the destruction of that state and the transformation of the
 Jewish community in Eretz Israel into one existing on Roman
 sufferance, the Pharisaic system of Jewish life, with its special
 emphasis on the individual internalization of Jewish norms, became
 the dominant one within the Jewish people, ultimately coming to
 embrace all Jews who remained within the fold.  The Pharisaic
 system, with its emphasis on schools as the principal
 institutional expression of organized Jewish life and such
 political power as remained in Jewish hands, scholars as the
 principal spokesmen for the Jewish people, and individual
 observance of a highly portable law as the touchstone of Jewish
 identification and self-expression, was uniquely adopted to the
 needs of the time.</p><p align="justify">


 Thus the diaspora experience strengthened the Pharisaic camp in
 every respect.  Lacking a proper political base, the Sadducee camp
 ultimately disappeared.  Significantly, the last bastion of
 Sadducean ideology was in Babylonia where the particular
 conditions of Jewish autonomy made the exilarch a focal point for
 its expression, but even the Exilarch had to come to terms with
 the heads of the academies in the course of time and became
 subordinate to them.</p><p align="justify">


 Essenism represented a recurring phenomenon in Jewish life in its
 own right, an effort to express Jewish messianic aspirations
 within the framework of a collectivist community, but Essenes,
 with their emphasis on relatively small communities as the means
 to fulfill the precepts of the Torah, similarly disappeared from
 the scene.  They required the protection of a strong Jewish
 presence and power in the land to maintain a protected existence
 as a separatist messianic minority within the Jewish fold.  Once
 that was gone, they could sustain their colonies.
</p><p align="justify">
 Pharisaic Judaism held fast for nearly 1800 years and was almost
 unchallenged for some 1500.  No longer a party within a larger
 framework, it became a framework itself.  It was only with the
 coming of the modern epoch in the seventeenth century that the
 order which it imposed upon the Jewish people began to break down
 under the pressures of modernization.  For some time, the only
 alternative to Pharisaic Judaism seemed to be assimilation.  It
 was only with the rise of modern Jewish nationalism and, most
 particularly Zionism, that another alternative emerged.</p><p align="justify">


 Once Pharisaic Judaism lost its dominant position, the Pharisees
 once again became a camp, today known as Orthodoxy.  It is no
 accident that Orthodoxy as a movement did not develop until the
 nineteenth century in response to the emancipationist movements.
 Up until that time, there was no need for a special framework for
 <I>halakhic</I> Jews as such.  Even the divisions within the <I>halakhic
</I> camp could be handled through traditional institutions.</p><p align="justify">


 Today the Pharisaic camp can be defined as consisting of Jews who
 see in <I>Halakhah</I> the central and unifying principle of Judaism.
 After a century or more of retreat, that camp is once again
 advancing.  They have turned to the offensive after years of being
 on the defensive, and have now developed institutions that are
 trying to "convert the Jews."  Their camp represents perhaps a
 quarter of the population of Israel and perhaps a fifth of world
 Jewry can be considered within it.</p><p align="justify">


 Of those among the remainder of world Jewry who identify Jewishly
 in some conscious way, a very small minority are neo-Essenes.  The
 latter are those who, in the Essene tradition, have sought to
 create total messianic societies within the framework of the
 existing world.  Most are to be found in the kibbutzim since the
 periodic diaspora experiments, for example the Jewish communes and
 havurot that appeared on or near the campuses of the United States
 in the late 1960's, cannot survive without the protection of a
 (Sadducean) state.</p><p align="justify">


 The largest group within the Jewish fold today and certainly the
 largest in Israel consists of those people who must be considered
 the heirs of the Sadducean tradition, even if only part of that
 camp operates within the framework of a Sadducean party. Today's
 neo-Sadducees include those Jews who seek to be Jewish through
 identification with Jewish history, culture, and tradition, but
 without necessarily accepting the authoritative character of
 halacha or the centrality of halacha in defining their Jewishness.
 In essence, these are people who tend to have a political sense of
 Judaism in the largest meaning of the term.  Thus they are
 committed to the Jewish people (either as a whole or as they exist
 within Israel), first and foremost, seeing in the expression of
 peoplehood or nationhood what can well be termed a religious
 obligation, the cornerstone of their civil religion. Increasingly,
 these neo-Sadducees have come to understand that the maintenance
 of Jewish peoplehood is a political act.  It was the Zionist
 movement that first came to recognize that the survival of the
 Jewish people in a post-Pharisaic age required a political revival
 and, consequently, who were the first to redefine Jewish life in
 explicitly political terms, relating to Jewish history and
 tradition through that perspective.</p><p align="justify">


 Virtually all of Israel's present political leadership and most of
 the diaspora Jewish leadership as well, are effectively within the
 Sadducean camp.  They have created an alliance with those of the
 Pharisaic camp who have joined with them in the common enterprise.
 The latter have had to join that enterprise principally on
 Sadducean terms, although they have been able to wring concessions
 from the Sadducean majority with regard to the maintenance of
 Pharisaic norms, because for the Sadducean camp Jewish unity is
 sufficiently important to warrant them.  Moreover, the Sadducees'
 own nostalgia for Jewish tradition makes those norms more
 acceptable, particularly since they have nothing viable to put in
 their place.</p><p align="justify">

 It was precisely that implicit understanding of what the
 Mizrachi's alliance with the World Zionist Movement meant that led
 to the great fight within the Orthodox camp during the early days
 of the Zionist revolution.  Agudat Yisrael sought to remain
 authentic Perushim (they often used the term) in the sense of
 being utterly willing to separate themselves from the majority of
 Jews to maintain what they believe was the only correct approach
 to Judaism.  The Mizrachi, on the other hand, was prepared to
 "taint itself" by association with the new non-Pharisaic majority
 to advance what it considered to be common Jewish goals, which it
 understood as valid per se within the Pharisaic tradition.</p><p align="justify">

 The Jewish people will have to reconcile itself to the renewed
 existence of this classic division within Jewish life.  The fact
 that some four-fifths of world Jewry is outside the Pharisaic
 camp, means that a Sadducean Judaism will develop whether the
 Pharisees will it or not.  The only question that is open is what
 will be its content?</p><p align="justify">


 The ancient Sadducees amy not have accepted the Pharisaic
 understanding of Judaism but they, too, shared a religious
 conception of Jewish existence.  The neo-Sadducean camp must begin
 to understand itself for what it is and develop an appropriately
 articulated Jewish framework within which to function, rather than
 simply transforming those elements of Pharisaic Judaism which are
 somewhat appealing into a kind of civil religion that is either no
 more than residually Jewish or which uses Jewish forms to promote
 un-Jewish content.</p><p align="justify">


 While that task falls upon the entire Jewish people, it is of
 particular concern and relevance to Israel which, as the center of
 the Jewish world and the only place where an autonomous Jewish
 culture flourishes, must make a greater effort to make that
 culture truly Jewish in one way or another.  The civil religion
 which has emerged in Israel represents the first articulation of a
 revived Sadducean approach to maintaining the rhythm of Jewish
 life.  No civilization can exist without having its own rhythm.  A
 great part of the genius of Judaism in general is to be found in
 the way it establishes a clear rhythm for all Jews and of
 Pharisaism in particular in the way it transformed that rhythm
 into a portable one, that could be carried into exile in every
 diaspora.  Normally life rhythms of particular civilizations are
 associated with particular locales. Zionism-as-Sadduceanism has
 emphasized the revaluation of traditional Jewish rhythms in ways
 that are held to the Israeli locale but, as we see all around us,
 under the influence of a universal culture, the way it has tried
 to do so is not enough.</p><p align="justify">


 The present trend is toward quite separate Judaisms on one level,
 despite the Sadducean borrowing of Pharisaic practices for their
 civil religion, withe each camp taking on the characteristics of a
 separate community within the Jewish state.  Interaction between
 the two camps should not only be fostered for the sake of Jewish
 unity, but for the sake of the proper expression of the Jewish
 spirit as well.</p><p align="justify">


 Since the very revival of the Sadducean camp is intertwined with
 the revival of the political expression of Jewishness through a
 Jewish state, more than any other movement in Judaism, the
 Sadducees need a living Jewish political tradition based on their
 first principled and properly rooted in Jewish sources and
 experience -- in the way that Pharisees require a living legal
 tradition, to provide them with the continuity which a tradition
 offers.  To suggest that the Sadducees are in special need of a
 Jewish political tradition is not in the least to suggest that the
 Pharisees do not need one.  Quite to the contrary, just as
 Pharisaic Judaism managed to absorb the ideology and symbols of
 the Davidic line and the Temple ritual, the two most important
 Sadducean traditions, in order to provide a comprehensive approach
 to Judaism and Jewishness, so too have they had to relate to the
 Jewish political tradition.
</p><p align="justify">

 Under the conditions in which Pharisaic Judaism became dominant,
 political consciousness as such had become dangerous for Jews, to
 having led to the disastrous revolts against Roman rule.  So the
 Pharisees absorbed and hid that tradition within the mainstream of
 the Halachah itself, carefully avoiding any reference to it as a
 political tradition.  In subsequent ages, this tradition survived
 and even thrived within the four ells of Halachic Judaism.  We are
 just now discovering how well it did.</p><p align="justify">


 As a consequence we have a paradoxical situation today.  The
 Jewish political tradition in its most authentic form lives within
 the Pharisee camp but the Pharisees themselves are least willing
 to recognize it as a political tradition.  One consequence of this
 is that they have done relatively little to come to grips with the
 problems of statehood within a halachic framework.  The Sadducees,
 on the other hand, have ignored that tradition and have built
 their political ideologies on foreign ideologies, mostly imported
 from Europe, which not only fail to help develop the Jewishness of
 the Jewish state but neutralize the Jewish commitments of the
 younger generation.
</p><p align="justify">
 For the Sadducees to recover the tradition, they must not only
 learn from their experience as Jews confronting political
 situations, but drink deeply from sources preserved by the
 Pharisees.  By the same token, while the Pharisees can continue to
 exist as individuals and in their communities by living off their
 own sources, in order to cope with statehood, they must become
 Sadducean to some degree.</p><p align="justify">


 The danger in a Jewish normalcy lies in the possibility of intense
 conflict between the two between the two principal camps, as was
 the case in the last epoch of the second Jewish Commonwealth.  At
 a time when the Jewish people seems to be breaking apart into
 separate camps or communities, and most especially in Israel, this
 mutual inter-dependence is a positive factor, a basis upon which
 to rebuild a more united and more Jewish state.  It is to be
 devoutly hoped that, in the Third Commonwealth, the intense
 conflicts which marked the Pharisee-Sadducee relationship in the
 Second will be avoided for the sake of the Jewish people as a
 whole.
