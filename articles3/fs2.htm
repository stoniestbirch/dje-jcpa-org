                      <H3><CENTER> Peoples and States</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">


The most permanent elements in the Middle East are not the
territorial states as they presently exist, but its peoples,
those primordial ethno-religious communities that reflect a
common kinship normally manifested through a common creed.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>  In
the long history of this region, the most ancient in the world,
empires, states, provinces, and cities have come and gone, but
the peoples have had an amazing persistence.  The Jews have had a
continuous recorded presence in the region for nearly 4000
years, and the Armenians, the Copts, the Arabs, the Kurds, the
Maronites, and others have histories stretching back two thousand
years or more.  Even such relative latecomers as the Turks have
been in the region for a millennium or more.  These peoples have
adjusted to different political structures, either as masters or
as subjects, and have persisted, while states have come and gone.
The Middle East is a mosaic of long-lived peoples who have used
various political devices over time to achieve as much political
self-determination as possible. The truly legitimate structures,
whether states or religious bodies, are those created by these
ancient peoples.  
</p><p align="justify">
The emergence of a Palestinian public that claims peoplehood is
significant in and of itself, and, as such, it deserves
appropriate consideration. Precisely because of the ancient
character of the peoples of the Middle East, the "instant
peoplehood" claimed by the Palestinian Arabs has been suspect in
Israeli eyes.  The Palestinian Arabs have, indeed, come to
constitute a "public," an intergenerational collectivity sharing
certain common interests and affected by a common set of
externalities within the Arab nation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>  This is principally a
result of their opposition to Zionism and Israel, which shaped
their collective identity over the past two generations; it is
also a result of their perceived mistreatment at the hands of the
Arab states.
</p><p align="justify">
There is a real distinction here. Peoples take form in the Middle
East, however, over centuries, not in a decade or two.  Now it
seems that the Palestinians' sense of common identity will
survive on a longer term basis, as it has for the Syrians, the
Iraqis, or the Egyptians, to make them a "people" within the
larger Arab nation.</p><p align="justify">

Israelis are coming to perceive this and to include it in their
calculus for peace. On the other hand, one of the aspects of the
Arab position vis-a-vis Israel and Zionism that most rankles
Israelis and other Jews and suggests to them that the Arabs are
unwilling to establish a permanent peace that recognizes Israel
as here to stay and an integral part of the region, is their
frequent denial of the very existence of the Jewish people.  Even
in recent years when Arab voices from King Hassan of Morocco to
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt to Yasser Arafat of the Palestine
Liberation Organization have made statements fully or apparently
recognizing the reality of Israel's existence and its right to
exist as a state, Arabs at all levels have continued to deny the
peoplehood of the Jews and therefore the fundamental legitimacy
of Zionism and the Jewish people's right to self-determination.
This stance actually denies the Jews the right to
self-definition.  
</p><p align="justify">
Jews continue to be seriously disturbed by the irony of the fact
that they, one of the world's oldest surviving peoples if not the
oldest, with a continuing historical existence, language and
culture of nearly 4,000 years, have their peoplehood challenged
again and again and have to constantly struggle to demonstrate
what should be a self-evident truth.  Since the beginning of the
Israel-Arab conflict the Arabs have taken the lead in this denial
of Jewish peoplehood.  Hence any request of the Jews to recognize
the new Palestinian Arab claim to peoplehood requires a prior
clear recognition of Jewish peoplehood on the part of the
Palestinians and other Arabs.  On this there can be no
compromise.</p><p align="justify">

All the evidence points to the conclusion that modernization has
not eliminated the primacy of primordial ethno-religious identity
but has sharpened certain aspects of it.  Those who thought that
the imposition of new categories of statehood would undermine the
old order have discovered their mistake, often through bloody
civil war or massacre.  Thus, in any agreement, the permanence of
ancient peoples and the precedence of their rights must be
considered, while claims of statehood on the basis of fifteen,
thirty, or even fifty years of national self-identification must
be demonstrated.
</p><BR>

                 <H3><CENTER>    Impermanent Boundaries</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


Even more than states, boundaries in the Middle East have been
highly impermanent, rarely lasting unchanged more than a
generation or two under the best conditions.  The Middle East
essentially consists of oasis areas of varying sizes surrounded
by deserts, and the struggle between the desert and the sown is
one of its few constants.  The continuous geographic identity
that exists in the region rests upon those oasis heartlands while
the territories in between have been regularly redivided among
them.</p><p align="justify">

There is not a single boundary in the Middle East today that is
as much as a hundred years old.  Israel's oldest boundary, for
example, is the Sinai boundary, which was drawn in 1906. Israel's
northern boundaries were established in the early 1920s, and its
eastern boundaries have never been established except on an
interim basis.  The same is true of the boundaries of Syria and
of Egypt, as well as of Jordan, an "artificial" state whose
oldest boundaries date to the 1920s and which does not even have
a historic heartland known by that name.</p><p align="justify">

Nor is this phenomenon simply a result of modern nation-building
in the region.  It is a recurring pattern.  Even during the days
of imperial rule, the boundaries changed regularly as a result of
external and internal wars, and the imperial powers were
constantly redividing their territories.  The Ottoman Turks
redrew the provincial boundaries in what was known as Syria and
Palestine on the average of twice every century.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>  The whole
purpose of boundaries in the Middle East has not been to
encompass geographically fixed nations but to provide security
for the peoples of the various heartlands or for the powers that
could make their needs felt.  To repeat, in this region peoples
are constant, not boundaries.</p><BR>



<H3><CENTER>                   The Mixtures of Populations</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Not only are peoples more persistent than political structures
and boundaries, but the peoples are so situated that homogeneous
states have rarely if ever been attained in the region.
Homogeneous areas, except for Egypt, are the size of relatively
small provinces or medium-size American counties.  In urban
areas, the groups have usually been substantially intermixed or
separated into neighborhood groupings at most.  In rural areas,
the division has often been on a village by village basis, which
greatly complicates drawing boundaries on a more than local
plane.  History has demonstrated that any successful political
arrangement in the region must satisfy the majority people within
its compass while maintaining the communal rights of the
minorities within the jurisdiction.  Thus every polity in the
region is, in some respects, a compound one, with no possibility
of becoming an ethnically unitary nation-state -- the desideratum
of European theories of nationalism -- without resorting to
expulsion or genocide.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                      Peace and Sovereignty
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

As a consequence of the factors mentioned in the foregoing
discussion, peace has existed in the Middle East only under
conditions when now-conventional notions of sovereignty have been
drastically limited and principles of shared power have operated
in their place.  The empires that have brought peace to the
region, particularly the ancient Persian Empire and the more
recent Ottoman Empire, were built on principles of local
autonomy, in some cases ethno-religious and in others a
combination of ethnic and territorial.  Each of the peoples
within the imperial system was granted or guaranteed some
significant measure of cultural, religious, and even political
self-determination or home rule within the imperial framework.
The rulers of these empires recognized the constants, or "facts
of life," in the Middle East for what they were.  Unfortunately,
the historical record shows that only when there have been
dominant empires have peaceful relations obtained, albeit at some
cost.  When the region has broken up into separate states or
small imperial domains, interstate warfare has constantly
disrupted the stability of the populations as well as the
boundaries. </p><p align="justify">

Today, we are once again in a period in which the region is
divided among many states, with the resultant strife.  Not only
is there the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
During the post-World War II generation -- the first of
independent statehood for most of the states in the region --
there were civil wars in Afghanistan, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Iraq,
Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, and Yemen; revolutions based on
ethno-religious differences in Lebanon and Syria; interstate
conflicts or border clashes between Egypt and Libya, Iraq and
Iran (a particularly long and brutal affair), Ethiopia and
Somalia (not to mention Eritrea), Syria and Turkey, Syria and
Jordan; and such foreign interventions as the Egyptian war in
Yemen of the mid-1960s (which added a new twist to the general
pattern of regional conflict through the use of poison gas) and
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.</p><p align="justify">

None of the peoples in the region would wish for a return of
imperialism, even in the name of peace. Nor would any of the
states in the area wish to sacrifice their independence for
peace.  However, the record has once again demonstrated that a
system of fully sovereign states as developed in eighteenth and
nineteenth century Europe is not appropriate to the Middle East.
Thus innovations are necessary to achieve peace within the
framework of modern nationalism and, one hopes, democracy.  Such
innovations must be in keeping with the spirit of the region, not
foreign transplants likely to be rejected by the region's bodies
politic.  In the development of these innovations, it is even
possible to learn from old imperial solutions, even if these
cannot be applied as they were in imperial times.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                  Extraterritorial Arrangements</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


Two arrangements stand out as having had success in imperial
systems that kept the peace in the past.  One is the principle of
ethnic autonomy, or home rule, what in the Ottoman period was
known as the millet system, and the other is the principle of
extraterritoriality, whereby particular groups are protected by
external powers with which they have an affinity, known in
Ottoman times as capitulations.</p><p align="justify">

Both the millet and capitulation systems have been roundly
rejected by the newly sovereign states, jealous of their
sovereign prerogatives.  Remnants of the millet system persist,
however, in every one of those states, and the outside
intervention of brethren or of great powers has been tacitly
reaffirmed.  Even the most extreme among them have discovered
that, unless they are willing to exterminate minority populations
or to drive them out -- the pattern followed by the first new
states in the region early in the twentieth century -- some
accommodation must be made with them.  All but the most extreme
rulers have found that it costs less to do so by giving formal or
informal cultural and religious autonomy in some spheres, and
even legal powers in matters of personal status (marriage,
divorce, and inheritance are the most common of these), rather
than to try to forbid ways of life that date from antiquity.</p><p align="justify">

With a few exceptions, these accommodations have not been
constitutionalized in writing because of the reluctance of the
new states to set formal limits on their sovereignty, but, for
all intents and purposes, they cannot be changed without civil
war or great upheaval.  Although not every group can have a state
in the complex pattern of the Middle East, each can secure the
wherewithal to preserve its own integrity through such
accommodations as they become constitutionalized over time.</p><BR>



<H3><CENTER>             The Interests of the Concerned Parties
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Although it is impossible to meet all the interests and demands
of the parties directly involved in the conflict, any compromise
must be based on satisfying at least their minimal interests,
reflecting their relative power positions.  We distinguish
between three sets of parties:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">
The parties directly involved in any settlement -- Israel,
Jordan, and the Palestinian Arabs;<BR>

<LI> The great powers -- particularly the United States;<BR>

<LI> Egypt and the other Arab states.</p></ol><p align="justify">
<BR>

<H3>1. The Parties Directly Involved -- Israel, Jordan, and the
Palestinian Arabs.</H3></p><p align="justify">

The following specific needs of the three parties must be
guaranteed.</p><p align="justify">

<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Israel:</I></FONT></p><ul><LI><p align="justify">
Peace secured by formal treaty;</p><LI><p align="justify">
Security arrangements on its eastern border providing
strategic depth, early warning against any possible enemy attack,
protected airspace, control of vital roads for defense purposes,
and minimum exposure to terrorist infiltration from the east;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Maintaining governance over a united Jerusalem as its capital;</p><LI><p align="justify">
The right of Jews to reside in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza
District.</p></ul><p align="justify">

<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Palestinians:</I></FONT></p><ul><LI><p align="justify">
 Recognition of their national identity, and practical
expression of that identity;</p><LI><p align="justify">

Continuation of the special links with Jordan and the Arab
world;</p><LI><p align="justify">


 Continuation of economic links with Israel.</p></ul><p align="justify">

<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Jordan:</I></FONT></p><ul><LI><p align="justify">
 Protection against possible extremist Palestinian factions: in
other words, the protection of the Hashemite regime (with
reference to the fear of internal conflict that could occur in
Jordan after the creation of a Palestinian Arab state);</p><LI><p align="justify">
 Formal and practical expression of the bonds between the
inhabitants of Judea and Samaria and those of the Hashemite
kingdom;</p><LI><p align="justify">
 Official duties and responsibilities regarding the holy sites
of the three religions.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>

<H3>2. The Great Powers</H3></p><p align="justify">

The United States and the USSR have long-term interests in the
Middle East.  The USSR has a direct security interest in the
region which abuts its southern border -- an interest which will
persist no matter what kind of regime exists in Russia.  In
addition, there is a longstanding Russian interest in gaining or
maintaining access to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf.
Beyond that there is the Soviet interest in gaining hegemony in
the region to deprive the West of its major supply of oil.
Failing the attainment of hegemony, there is a Soviet interest in
preventing American hegemony; its involvement in the Arab-Israeli
conflict is to a great extent related to the latter effort.</p><p align="justify">

The United States also has long-term interests in the region
related to the fact that most of its imported oil supply and the
bulk of the oil used in Western Europe and Japan comes from the
Middle East.  Beyond that, it has its own strategic interests
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union and desire to maintain a certain
hegemony over the area to protect those interests.  Its immediate
interest is to maintain stability in the Middle East and its
relationship to Israel is related to its assessment of the
respective roles of Israel and particular Arab states
contributing to that stability.</p><p align="justify">

Given the foregoing, the Soviet Union is not overly interested in
a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and supports the
rejectionist states so as to prevent such a settlement.  It is
only likely to accept such a settlement if it were to be involved
in some way or if the cost of opposing the settlement would be
too great.  The United States, on the other hand, is particularly
interested in settling the Arab-Israeli conflict in its search
for stability, providing that such a settlement would affirm
Israel's right to exist while not interfering with traditional
U.S.-Arab ties.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3>3. Egypt and the Arab States</H3></p><p align="justify">

The Arab states fall into three groups: (1) Egypt, which has
signed a peace treaty with Israel and which is obligated under
the terms of that treaty to take the lead in negotiating a
political solution for the Palestinian Arabs; (2) the
rejectionist states; (3) the other Arab states.</p><p align="justify">

Egypt's interest has effectively been reduced to supporting
Jordan and some appropriate Palestinian Arab leadership in a
solution that will be acceptable to them. Hence its role in any
future negotiations would be less that of a direct party than an
involved party in the manner of the United States.  The
rejectionist Arab states will continue to reject any settlement
that recognizes Israel as a legitimate state.  They will maintain
this stance in cooperation with the Soviet Union, their patron.
The other Arab states operate on two principles: (1) like Egypt,
a willingness to endorse a solution agreeable to Jordan and
acceptable to the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs; and
(2) a deep commitment not to formally surrender sovereignty over
any "Arab lands."  If judicious efforts are made, they can be
brought to accept a resolution of the conflict which formally
maintains those two principles.
</p><p align="justify">
While a distinction must be made between the great powers and the
Arab states, the existence of common interests between
participants in both camps creates temporary alliances among the
two groups. The common interests of the Soviet Union, the
rejectionist Arab states, and the PLO in the past have
constituted a negative factor in the effort to advance stability
in the Middle East. Despite the presence of differing views
between Israel, Egypt and other pro-Western Arab states, it can
be hoped that the United States and the non-rejectionist Arab
states who support stability and the achievement of a
comprehensive political settlement will accept whatever political
settlement is negotiated between Israel, the Palestinians, and
Jordan.</p><p align="justify">

It is therefore a necessary condition that initially the three
direct parties reach an agreement among themselves.  Once such an
agreement is adopted it will find support within the
non-rejectionist Arab camp.  This support should be sufficient to
neutralize the negative influence of the rejectionist Arab states
and the Soviet Union.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                     Four Possible Solutions
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

There are four approaches to resolving the conflict over the
territories:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">
 Israel's withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders, either fully or
with the most minor territorial modifications;</p><LI><p align="justify">

The extension of Israeli sovereignty over (annexation of)
Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza District;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Repartition of the territories to accommodate Israel's
security needs (e.g., the Allon Plan);</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Some form of shared rule over the territories by Israel and an
Arab partner.</p></ol><p align="justify">

The first two approaches contain grave threats to the various
parties involved and therefore there is no chance of their being
accepted.  Either total withdrawal or total absorption is
contrary to the basic non-negotiable interests of one or another
of the concerned parties.  Option three, the repartition of
Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza District on terms more favorable to
Israel, may be more feasible although, while it is acceptable to
many Israelis, to date it has been firmly rejected by the Arabs.
This leaves shared rule as the only potentially workable
alternative.</p><p align="justify">

The following six goals must be achieved by any workable plan:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">
Sufficient Israeli military presence in the territories, at
least for an interim period, to guarantee Israel's security;</p><LI><p align="justify">


 Self-rule for the Palestinian Arabs;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The right of Jews to reside in the territories;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Free movement of Israelis, Jordanians, and Palestinian Arabs
into and out of the territories, to be agreed upon by the
concerned parties;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The right of all residents of the territories to freely choose
their citizenship among the options agreed upon and to live
within a communal and political framework that gives that
citizenship meaningful expression;</p><LI><p align="justify">


 Substantial economic integration of Israel, the territories,
and Jordan.</p></ol><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>1. Withdrawal as a Solution</H3></p><p align="justify">

There is a virtual consensus in Israel that a full Israeli
withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders is totally unacceptable.
Israel's need for defensible borders remains paramount among its
security needs.  The definition of defensible borders are borders
that, if breached, still allow for the adequate defense of the
country and its population centers.</p><p align="justify">

Strictly speaking, there are no pre-1967 borders.  The
demarcation lines establishing the armistice between Israel and
Jordan in 1949 left an Arab state bordering on the most populous
areas and the industrial heartland of Israel.  The distance from
Israel's pre-1967 eastern border to the sea varied from a mere 7
miles at Netanya, to 12 miles at Tel Aviv, toa little over 23
miles at Haifa.  The armistice agreement between Israel and Egypt
left the Egyptians within approximately 50 miles of Tel Aviv.
Thus whoever controls Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza District
threatens the whole coastal area with artillery and even hand
rockets, from Haifa in the north and Ashkelon (Israel's oil port)
in the south, including the entire Tel Aviv metropolitan region,
Ashdod (Israel's largest port) and most of the country's
industry, not to speak of Jerusalem and the country's
international airport at Lod, both of which are either right on
or within 2 miles of the old line.  If we add to this the unique
topography of the Judean and Samarian mountains, which puts the
coastal areas in plain view from virtually the entire central
mountain ridge, and the threat of terrorist activity, it is easy
to understand Israel's position regarding those territories.</p><p align="justify">

Given modern-day military capabilities, the strategic depth which
the territories afford Israel serve to underscore the
imperativeness of defensible borders.  An attack of the 1973 war
magnitude on the pre-1967 borders would have resulted in the
overrunning of major Israeli population centers. Now, nearly ten
years later, the suggestion of a full Israeli withdrawal is under
no circumstances a realistic option.</p><p align="justify">

Furthermore, a full Israeli withdrawal would not be advantageous
to the Palestinian Arabs.  At this writing, Israel will not
accept a Palestinian state.  Even partial withdrawal for that
purpose is unacceptable to the Israeli government and a majority
of Israelis.  What remains, then, as a possibility lunder such
circumstances is a Palestinian-Jordanian federation that would
leave the Palestinians at the mercy of Jordan's Hashemite regime
and its army, which have crushed them in the past and dominated
them for nineteen years.  The only way that a Palestinian link
with Jordan would ensure protection for the Palestinian Arabs
would be if it also included an Israeli presence.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>2. Israeli Absorption as a Solution</H3></p><p align="justify">

While the present Israeli government undoubtedly would prefer the
extension of Israeli sovereignty of Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza
District, it understands that this is impossible since it is not
only totally unacceptable to the Arabs but would be equally
unacceptable to the international community, including the United
States.  Moreover, the existence of a substantial Arab population
with nationalistic aspirations rules out any unilateral Israeli
action to simply incorporate the territories into the Jewish
state without providing some means of self-rule for their Arab
inhabitants.  Indeed, there are many who argue that annexation
would present a serious domestic threat to Israeli society and
its political institutions by absorbing more than a million Arabs
into its polity.
</p><BR>
<p align="justify">
<H3>3. Partition as a Solution</H3></p><p align="justify">

The conventional response to the problem of the Arab-Israeli
conflict has been to support a repartition of the land west of
the Jordan River, whether through a complete Israeli withdrawal
to the pre-1967 lines (the Arab position); a withdrawal with
"minor territorial adjustments" (the American position); or a
major redrawing of the boundaries along the lines of the Allon
Plan (the position of the Israeli Labor party).  This response
also has proved to be inadequate -- a "non-starter" in one way or
another.  To date, the Arabs have refused to concede to the
Israelis the serious border adjustments that constitute israel's
minimum demands.</p><p align="justify">

The truth is that the west and east banks of the Jordan, from the
Mediterranean Sea to the eastern desert, constitute one land and
must be treated as such, even if it is to be divided between two
states Since the Churchill-Abdullah accord of 1922 which detached
Transjordan from the Jewish national home in Palestine provided
by the League of Nations Mandate, the whole thrust of efforts to
achieve accommodation between Jews and Arabs has been based upon
partition of the land between them.  The Peel Commission report
of 1937 carried the idea a step further with a plan to divide
western Palestine as well.  While it was never implemented, the
idea was revived in the 1947 UN partition plan which was adopted
as the basis for establishing Jewish and Arab states in western
Palestine.
</p><p align="justify">
In fact, the Transjordanian invasion of western Palestine in 1948
restored the connection between parts of western and eastern
Palestine (Transjordan).  The armistice agreements signed between
Israel and Jordan in 1949 ratified a partition status quo between
the two.  The Jordanian aggression in the Six-Day War destroyed
that status quo.</p><p align="justify">

Partition of that share of the land west of the Jordan River,
once a reasonable and even an effective solution to the
intercommunal conflict, is no longer adequate.  The following
factors militate against partition:</p><p align="justify">

<I>a) Strategic threats to Israel:</I></p><p align="justify">
A partition "solution" along the lines now apparently so ardently
desired by Egypt and the Western world which existed between
1949 and 1967 did not lead to a peace treaty -- the "borders"
themselves remained merely armistice lines which did not even
provide Israel with security.  Their vulnerability led to a
continuing state of guerrilla warfare, innumerable border
incidents, and finally a major war.</p><p align="justify">

<I>b) Jerusalem:</I></p><p align="justify">
By now it should be clear to all that Israel will never agree to
repartition of its capital, while Jordan and the rest of the Arab
world would never agree to Israeli sovereignty over their holy
places.,
</p><p align="justify">
<I>c) Shared physical resources:</I></p><p align="justify">
Another major obstacle concerns the common resources shared by
Jordan, Israel and the territories in between.  All three share
common water resources, both ground water and the Jordan River
basin.  A larger portion of Israel's water resources, which are
extremely limited to begin with, could be destroyed by imprudent
-- or deliberate -- action by the other side.  This could amount
to a threat to Israel's survival that would not be controlled by
disarmament agreements or demilitarized zones.  Likewise, Israel
and Jordan and the territories in between share major sources
of energy, such as the Dead Sea per se or the difference in
static head between sea level and the Dead Sea which could
produce an alternative energy source.</p><p align="justify">

<I>d) Economic interdependence:</I></p><p align="justify">
The economic interdependence between the various parts of Eretz
Israel/Palestine has also become a barrier to repartition.  In
earlier years, the basically agricultural economies of both sides
involved relatively little interdependence.  A modern
sophisticated economy, on the other hand, is by its very nature
based on an interlocking effort of all its parts.  This is what
has developed in all the land west of the Jordan since 1967.  Not
that it cannot be divided -- politics can triumph over economics
in such matters, as we have seen elsewhere -- but at a very real
price, especially for the Arabs.</p><p align="justify">

<I>e) Jordan, the Palestinian Arabs, and the PLO:</I><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
In addition, we have to take into account the relationship
between the Palestinian community and the Jordanian regime. While
the relationship between Jordan, the Palestinians, and the PLO
has been an ambivalent one, to say the least, it is a permanent
one which cannot be severed, given certain geohistorical and
political realities.  Some 70 percent of the population of
present Jordan (the east bank) is Palestinian by the most narrow
definition of the term, namely, people who emigrated from the
West Bank in 1948 or after and their children. In fact, since we
are talking about one land, all Jordanians are Palestinians
except the Hashemite ruling family and the handful of people who
came with them to Transjordan in 1921-22.  
</p><p align="justify">
The group which has clear roots in the territories west of the
Jordan River is now permanently settled on the east bank.  It
constitutes the largest single concentration of Palestinian Arabs
in the world, over a third of the total.  Thus, willy-nilly,
Jordan will have a relationship with the Palestinian Arabs
everywhere by virtue of its demography, not to speak of its
geohistorical location.  At the same time, Jordan as a
British-Hashemite family creation has sought to forge a separate
Jordanian identity in part through repression of the Palestinian
Arabs and their identity.</p><p align="justify">

Jordan's rule over Judea and Samaria in the period between 1948
and 1967 could be best classified as a quasi-military control
system by a minority over a Palestinian Arab majority.  Between
1967 and 1970, Jordan more or less represented the Palestinian
Arabs in Judea and Samaria vis-a-vis the Israeli authorities and
the world, working with the PLO, which emerged as a force in
those years, until the latter came to be seen as too great a
threat to the Hashemite regime.  This led to the Jordanian
assault on the PLO in September 1970 and the massacre of
PLO-oriented Palestinian Arabs in late 1970 and early 1971.
Dissension between the two communities grew and the proclamation
of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the principal
spokesman for the Palestinian Arabs at the Rabat Conference in
1974 formally denied Jordan's previous status as spokesman for
those Palestinian Arabs.</p><p align="justify">

Jordan did not fade from the scene, however, because realities
would not allow it, continuing to provide services as well as
financial assistance to the inhabitants of Judea and Samaria.
By 1979, Jordan and the PLO reestablished their alliance
and undertook joint efforts in the territories, succeeding to the
point where the pro-PLO mayors elected in the 1976 municipal
elections in Judea and Samaria, in opposition to the candidates
endorsed by Jordan, became allies of this new PLO-Jordanian
axis.  By late 1982, Jordan had reassumed a major role vis-a-vis
the Palestinian Arabs, and King Hussein was seeking ways to bring
Yasser Arafat and the PLO to accept his role as dominant partner
in the negotiations with Israel called for in the Reagan Plan,
and in a future Jordan-Palestinian confederation.</p><p align="justify">

For the next four years various efforts were made by the United
States, Egypt, and King Hussein to bring Arafat and the PLO to
recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce terrorism, and thus
become acceptable to the Americans as a partner in peace
negotiations.  Arafat maneuvered his way around any formal
statement until in March 1986 it became apparent that the PLO was
not ready for such a step.  Hussein and Arafat broke off their
alliance and Hussein, in cooperation with the Israelis,
determined to return unilaterally to the West Bank and begin to
develop ties with Gaza as well.
</p><p align="justify">
By the end of the summer of 1986, Hussein and the Israeli
government had agreed to introduce a de facto Israeli-Jordanian
condominium in the West Bank and Gaza to test out the
possibilities of establishing a permanent or at least an
indefinitely institutionalized shared rule arrangement.  Israel
agreed to cooperate with Jordan to reestablish the Jordanian
government's power position west of the river and indeed did so
in September and October of 1986.  
</p><p align="justify">
Then, after the rotation in Israel's national unity government,
when Shimon Peres relinquished the prime ministership to Yitzhak
Shamir and took over the foreign ministry, Peres unilaterally
initiated a call for an international conference to negotiate
peace, against Shamir's wishes.  Peres' initiative ended forward
progress toward condominium as the Palestinians, who had been
moving hesitantly toward cooperation with Jordan, stopped to see
what the initiative would bring.  By April 1987 it was apparent
that Peres' initiative would not bring about a peace conference.
In the meantime, Peres and Hussein reached a secret agreement in
London that effectively stopped the movement toward long term
shared rule as well, with Peres promising Hussein exclusive
control of some of the West Bank through a repartition.  
</p><p align="justify">
The Jordanians then increased their efforts to reestablish their
presence in the territories but it was too late.  Pressure
building up within them led to the outbreak of the intifada on
December 9, 1987, in essence the Palestinians' own initiative. At
the end of July 1988, King Hussein formally severed all of
Jordan's connections with the territories, ending 21 years of
Jordanian support for West Bank programs and personnel,
eliminating West Bank representation in the Jordanian government
and parliament, and stopping the payment of salaries to former
Jordanian officials in the territories.  
</p><p align="justify">
This was not the end of the story, however.  Subsequently,
Hussein, Arafat, and President Mubarak of Egypt met in Aqaba
(October 1988) to discuss new ways of cooperation.  Relations
between the Hashemite kingdom and the PLO have continued to
fluctuate.
</p><p align="justify">
The periodic rapprochements between Hussein and Arafat reflect
both sides' recognition of the inevitable interdependence between
the Palestinians and Jordan.  The wariness of their
rapprochements is equally indicative of the degree to which each
has severe reservations about the other and, indeed, a certain
natural hostility.  It is no secret that the Palestinian national
movement seeks to establish its state on both sides of the
Jordan, to replace Hussein on the east bank as much as to
eliminate Israel on the west.  Since Hussein knows this, he is
committed to keeping the Palestinian Arabs under tight control to
protect his regime.  In fact, Israel's role as a balance between
them can serve in the interests of both, whereas left alone the
conflicts between Hashemite Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs are
likely to be unending.
</p><p align="justify">
The proposed plans for repartition of the territories not only
call for the return of most of Judea and Samaria to Jordan, but
the transfer of the Gaza District with its 400,000 Palestinian
Arabs to Jordanian rule.  They would only add to the problems of
the Jordanian regime.  A likely response of the Hashemite regime
to this would be to divert such nationalist feelings against the
Jewish state and try to mobilize Palestinian Arab support by
presenting itself as the champion of the Palestinian cause -- or,
as they define it, the "liberation" of the rest of "Palestine."</p><p align="justify">

<I>f) The threat to stability by the creation of a PLO state:</I></p><p align="justify">
The creation of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan River
cannot be considered a reasonable option for Israel.  First of
all, the creation of a second Arab state within the historic Land
of Israel/Palestine ignores the Palestinian character of Jordan
so that such a plan would actually permanently divide the
Palestinians rather than unite them.  Even disregarding Israel's
own need for secure borders, such a state would be very small and
poor relative to its neighbors, hence it would be extraordinarily
vulnerable to extremist control.  Under the best circumstances,
it could not help but be a nest for continued terrorist activity.</p><p align="justify">

The federal option is the only realistic proposal for achieving a
comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Despite
the difficulties surrounding any federal arrangement, such a
solution becomes feasible when it is offered within a broad
framework encompassing one or another of various flexible models.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                    From Partition to Sharing
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

The framework of peace signed by President Carter, Prime Minister
Begin, and President Sadat in the final dramatic moment of the
Camp David summit marked a turning point in Israel-Arab
accommodation.  It not only put both parties on the road to a
peace settlement, but also changed the basis for making peace by
necessitating some combination of self-rule and shared rule for
Jews and Arabs (or for Israel, the Palestinian Arabs, and Jordan)
within the land.</p><p align="justify">

The Six-Day War did not solve the problems of peace in the land
because the Arabs settled in the territories formerly occupied by
Egypt and Jordan were not prepared to be annexed by Israel.
Rather, the war stimulated a sense of Palestinian identity, which
had been relatively dormant. Had the Palestinian Arabs been
willing to acquiesce to citizenship in an enlarged Israel, the
partition solution of 1922 would have been restored.  This,
indeed, became the goal of certain substantial elements on the
Israeli political scene, including Menachem Begin's Likud, which
was to gain power in the May 1977 elections.</p><p align="justify">

On the other hand, the Labor party, which was in power during the
Six-Day War, never fully crystallized its position but leaned to
a repartition of the territory west of the Jordan, on terms more
advantageous to Israel's security.  This position was embodied in
the Allon Plan, which was based on the premise that the heavily
populated hill country - the oasis heartland of the West Bank --
with its large concentration of Arabs, would be returned to
Jordan in some way, while Israel would annex a wider band of
sparsely populated territory along the western foothills, plus
the virtually uninhabited Jordan valley.  The proponents of this
plan had no more success than those who espoused the Likud
position in persuading the Arabs, or, for that matter, Israel's
own friends, to accept it.  The Arabs insisted on a return to the
pre-Six-Day War borders, and, for all intents and purposes,
the Americans supported that demand.  Stalemate ensued.</p><p align="justify">

The events of 1977 to 1979 broke that stalemate.  A major element
in breaking it is the shift away from partition as the basis for
a settlement and a search for other alternatives. Simply put,
partition has reached a dead end.  None of the three partition
schemes on the table is acceptable to more than one of the
parties involved.  In current diplomatic slang, they have become
"nonstarters."</p><p align="justify">

The first formal break in partitionist thinking came with Begin's
announcement of his autonomy plan in December 1977.  That plan,
although purposely limited, for the first time formally suggested
that the solution to the problem lies not in partition but in
some combination of self-rule and shared rule.  Rejected at first
by the Arabs, it was accepted by the Americans as a possible
basis for an interim arrangement.  With some significant
modifications, it became the basis for the interim arrangement
agreed upon for a five-year period at Camp David.  Each of the
two parties to the conflict accepted this new framework for its
own reasons, reasons that are virtually contradictory in their
expectations.  That was why the subsequent negotiations between
Israel and Egypt to implement autonomy for the Palestinians
failed.  Nevertheless, the change in direction was not reversed.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3><CENTER>                The Revival of the Federal Option
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
The shift from the pursuit of partition to the pursuit of federal
arrangements sounds a theme that has been played in a minor key
throughout the history of the Israel-Arab conflict, raising it to
new importance.  Between 1917 and 1977, over sixty proposals for
federal solutions were advanced, all following conventional
models of federation and confederation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT> None of these succeeded
because they were all based upon unrealistic expectations of
Jewish-Arab cooperation.  Between 1948 and 1967, proponents of
federal solutions were muted, though they did not entirely
disappear.  A few remained to build paper castles in the sky.</p><p align="justify">

After the Six-Day War, the search for such solutions received a
new impetus.  The idealists reemerged with beautiful plans that
continued to ignore stubborn realities, but even more cautious
realists began to suggest that the federal option was the only
one that offered any promise at all.  Moshe Dayan suggested a
functional solution for the administered territories involving
shared rule by Israel and Jordan.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT> Shimon Peres endorsed the
pursuit of federal options in a vague way within two years after
the war, later elaborating a plan for a redivision of the entire
Cis-Jordanian area into several Jewish and Arab cantons.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT> Even
Yigal Allon at one point suggested that West Bank areas be linked
to Jordan in a federation, and that the whole be confederated
with Israel.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

Unfortunately, none of these plans, nor those put forward by
others outside of political life (such as this writer), found any
response in the Arab camp.  Now for the first time there is a
slim but real possibility that federal solutions will find
support on that side as well.</p><p align="justify">

A detailed look at the text of the framework for peace in the
Middle East, with all its ambiguities and opportunities for
interpretation in one direction or another, indicates why this is
so.  On one hand, the framework provides for "a self-governing
authority...freely elected by the inhabitants" of the West Bank
and Gaza on a transitional basis under the supervision of Israel,
Jordan, and Egypt.  What is suggested here and for the future
final settlement is a Palestinian entity that will not be a
sovereign state, and hence will have to be linked with some
state.  The question of which state is left open.  The provision
for Jordan's entry into joint arrangements with Israel leaves
open the possibility for a link to Jordan, Israel, or both.</p><p align="justify">

In view of Israel's position against full evacuation of the
territories and the Arabs' position against full relinquishment
of any part of them, only one option remains, namely some kind of
shared arrangement.  This option is strengthened by the Camp
David requirement that Jordan, Egypt, and Israel be involved in
any decision affecting the Palestinians' future, along with the
representatives of the Palestinian inhabitants of the
territories.  The provision for joint committees and security
forces was a first step toward some kind of shared rule, though
they were to be established only for a five-year interim basis.</p><p align="justify">

All told, the Camp David agreement was a major step toward some
combination of self-rule and shared rule, which is characteristic
of all federal arrangements.  Even if the parties to the
agreement move beyond it in their renewed efforts to resolve the
conflict, they must continue to recognize the possibilities
inherent in such arrangements and the severe limitations if not
impossibility of any other approach.
</p><BR>

        <H3><CENTER>           Symmetries and A-Symmetries</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">


What we have confronting us is an effort to come to grips with a
situation in which two energetic peoples with certain fundamental
interests that are diametrically opposed, are fated to share the
same land.  Somehow, they must find sufficient common grounds
upon which to build a basis for settlement.  To say that this may
seem well nigh impossible is not enough.  More than two
generations of conflict have shown the improvidence of continuing
on a collision course.  In human history, peoples often continue
to be improvident but it is not necessary for them to be.
</p><p align="justify">
In the language of contemporary international relations, there
are both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements in the
relationship between Israel and the Palestinians.  Increasingly,
the Palestinians are becoming the "Jews" of the Arab world.
Their diaspora is spread throughout that world and increasingly
plays that kind of role within each of the Arab states that the
Jewish diaspora communities traditionally have played in the
Christian and Muslim worlds.  In both cases, the peoples,
wherever they live, look to their original homeland as a focal
point in their lives, even if they do not intend to live there,
and are willing to supply it with resources and to exert
political and other forms of influence as necessary to protect or
secure what they perceive to be their homelands' interest.</p><p align="justify">

These symmetries are becoming widely recognized.  At the same
time, they should not obscure the asymmetrical aspects of the
relationship.  The Palestinian Arabs remain Arabs, that is to
say, their relationship to the Arab world is one of kinship, even
if it is a kinship that sometimes is less recognized in practical
policy matters than the Palestinians would like.  Whatever their
difficulties outside of Palestine, they have a score of other
Arab states which share the same language, religion and culture.
They even have a state -- Jordan -- which has always been
considered a part of their claimed homeland and in which they
form a demographic majority.</p><p align="justify">

The Jews, on the other hand, may have a more widespread diaspora
which feels at home in other parts of the world, but as Jews they
have only one possibility for a homeland in which their own
language and religion, culture and ways form the basis of its
society and polity.  Moreover, no one has tried to exterminate
the Palestinians.  The Jews have not only undergone centuries of
persecution, at times bordering on extermination, but came close
to being exterminated in our own time and have been subject to
further extermination efforts on the part of their immediate
neighbors.
</p><p align="justify">
Finally, the Palestinian Arabs may indeed be on the way to
becoming a separate people as well as a separate public within
the Arab world. The Jews, on the other hand, are the most ancient
of peoples, a nation whose history stretches back to the early
days of civilization and which has tenaciously preserved its
peoplehood and its national identity under the most adverse
conditions for thousands of years.</p><p align="justify">

Moreover, despite the substantial concentration of Palestinian
Arabs in the administered territories, the center of Palestinian
political and military power is with the PLO outside of the
claimed Palestinian homeland.  The center of Jewish political and
military power, on the other hand, is unquestionably in Israel.
this leads to a real difference in both the amount of power each
is capable of mobilizing and an equally real difference in the
character of the demands of each.  Palestinians are coming to
recognize the implications of this:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">

that despite the PLO diplomatic victories in the UN and
   various capitals, it has come no closer to dislodging Israel
   from the territories or making real political gains toward its
   final goal, and cannot as long as Israel maintains its power
   on the spot, and</p><LI><p align="justify">

the originally stated goal of the PLO, namely destruction of
   Israel and Jordan and the establishment of a Palestinian state
   in all of historic Eretz Israel/Palestine, stands in the way
   of the interests of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judea,
   Samaria and Gaza who would be satisfied with the exercise of
   more modest claims but who cannot negotiate such claims as
   long as they are dominated -- through terror as well as other
   means -- by an external center.</p></ol><p align="justify">

Both the symmetries and the asymmetries must be taken into
consideration as a relationship is developed and the peace
process advanced.  This process is not a matter of one round of
negotiations or one final decision at this point, but it can be
initiated.</p><BR>
