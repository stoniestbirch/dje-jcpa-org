<H3><CENTER>                       General Principles
</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">
The development of a self-rule/shared rule arrangement will
require the utmost sensitivity to the needs of the various
parties involved.  It will have to deal with four principal
factors: peoples (or nations), publics, territory, and states.
Each of these four represents a separate element in the overall
equation.</p><p align="justify">



The two peoples involved, Jewish and Arab, must maintain the
maximum degree of independence, since there is little to
encourage them to share if that were not guaranteed.  The Jewish
majority in Israel wishes to preserve the Jewish character of
that state and their own Jewish identity, and the Arabs wish
self-determination to the fullest possible extent.</p><p align="justify">

Whether as a public or as a people, the Palestinians must be
given maximum feasible self-rule within a larger context of
sharing.  The Palestinian Arabs may have to accept an "entity"
less symbolically satisfying than a politically sovereign state,
but they will have taken a giant step toward self-rule, so that
their chances for full partnership will grow as the federative
elements are strengthened. The Arab states have been reluctant to
give more than lip service to the idea of a separate Palestinian
state -- and there is every reason to believe that they basically
oppose it.  This indicates that even if Israel were to agree to a
full withdrawal, the West Bank Palestinians would end up tied to
some larger Arab entity perhaps with even less opportunity for
self-rule than Israel is now offering.  Thus the Palestinian
Arabs should not be too unsettled in the long run if their
self-rule comes within a shared Jewish-Arab context.  The spread
of the Palestinian Arabs on both banks of the Jordan River augurs
well for their transformation into the dominant force in the Arab
state, sooner or later.  The limited yet very real linkage with
Israel on the west bank could protect them from the designs of
other Arab states or leaders.</p><p align="justify">

The territory now occupied by both peoples, on the other hand,
should be subject to the maximum feasible shared rule, since the
several claimants have legitimate claims to it.  Israel has a
historic right that has a certain status in international law,
while the Palestinians have a right of occupancy, strongly
supported in international politics.  The only way to satisfy
these conflicting claims is through sharing the territory in
some way.  The peoples in the Middle East have never depended upon
territory to legitimize or to maintain their existence; they only
use it as a form of accommodation.  They can enjoy self-rule as
peoples at the same time they share rule with other peoples over
the territory in which they all have vested rights.</p><p align="justify">

Finally, Israel and Jordan will wish to maintain their own
independence and status as politically sovereign entities.  At
the same time, they should be linked insofar as necessary to
provide the structural and institutional cement for the
arrangement.  Thus, their separate existence would be guaranteed
along with that of the Palestinian entity in a situation in which
certain functions, such as control of water resources, tourism, a
customs union, or whatever, would be handled by limited-purpose
joint authorities.</p><p align="justify">

If a solution is to be attained out of the momentum generated
since Camp David, the various sides must be prepared to explore
options along these lines.  Although the initial forms may be
less than any of the parties would wish, the doors will be opened
to a developmental process that could transform the states and
peoples of the entire land.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                         Eleven Options
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has identified eleven
basic options based on federal principles. While each of these
options is treated separately, they are not necessarily mutually
exclusive.  Each is comprehensive and may be considered as a
solution in and of itself; at the same time, each has various
dimensions and can be adapted in various ways. Moreover, elements
of each may be combined with others in any solution or
implemented in stages.  Each option is, in essence, a
prescription for a final settlement.  This chapter does not deal
with the stages involved in reaching such a settlement which no
doubt will have to be phased in.  The options include some very
favorable to one party or the other, and some that require
substantial concessions -- even risks -- on the part of either or
both.  Each will be examined in the body of this chapter.</p><p align="justify">

The eleven basic options are</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">
 An Israel-Palestine federation.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 An Israel-Palestine confederation.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 A federation of multiple Jewish and Arab cantons.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 A Palestinian Arab state (or entity) associated with Israel as
   a federacy (on the model of Puerto Rico and the United States
   or the Aaland Islands and Finland).</p><LI><p align="justify">
 An Israel-Jordan confederation with the Palestinian Arabs
   fully incorporated into the Jordanian polity.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 An Israel-Jordan confederation with a Palestinian Arab partner
   federated with one or the other.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 Israeli incorporation of the territories with an internal
   consociational arrangement put on a constitutional basis.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 A totally non-territorial consociational federation within the
   entire area.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Condominium: joint Israeli-Jordanian rule over the territories
   with the local authorities attached to one or the other for
   civil purposes.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Various partial or sectoral federal arrangements such as a
    customs union, common market, joint special-purpose
    authorities, serving two or three states with the capability
    of being further expanded (e.g., to include Lebanon).</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Bifederate arrangements with different kinds of links between
    Israel, Judea, Samaria and Gaza or Israel and the territories
    with or without Jordan.
</p></ol><p align="justify">

The options can be grouped into the following sets:

	
	 </p><OL type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

 Arrangements between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs
   exclusively, with a Palestinian entity (Options 1, 2, 3, 4).</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Comprehensive arrangements between Israel and Jordan (Options
   5, 6).</p><LI><p align="justify">


 Arrangements involving Israeli absorption of the territories
   (Options 7, 8).</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Multilateral arrangements for special purposes, on a less than
   comprehensive basis (Options 9, 10, 11).</p></OL><p align="justify">

Each option must be considered in light of the following critical
functional areas, judged according to the means to be used to
resolve the problems attached to each functional area:</p><p align="justify">

<OL type="1">
	<LI>  Foreign relations
	<LI>  Police and internal security
	<LI>  Military and external defense
	<LI>  Taxation
	<LI>  Customs, exports, and imports
	<LI>  Banking and currency
	<LI>  Definition of citizenship and control of immigration
	<LI>  Education
	<LI>  Religious sites and services
	<LI>  Ports
	<LI>  Transportation
	<LI>  Posts and telecommunications
	<LI>  Electric power
	<LI>  Water
	<LI>  Tourism
	<LI>  Health
	<LI>  Environmental protection
	<LI>  Economic development
	<LI>  Regulation of commerce and industry
</OL></p><p align="justify">

In implementing any particular option, the following critical
steps will have to be taken, although not necessarily in the
following order:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

Defining the critical functional areas to be assigned or
   reserved, in all or in part, separately or cooperatively, to
   each entity and to the general authority that will be
   established to serve them all.
</p><LI><p align="justify">
Defining the nature of common and separate political
   institutions, such as executive, legislative, and judicial
   bodies, including:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">
The method of selecting officials;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The assignment of powers and rules of procedure to each of
      the political institutions;</p><LI><p align="justify">


   Rules of suffrage and election;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Scheme or representing residents of each entity and federal
      district, if any, in their own and the general political
      institutions;</p><LI><p align="justify">

    Assignment of responsibility for the resolution of
      conflicts between the political institutions of each
      entity, or between the entities and the general authority.</p></ol><LI><p align="justify">

 Defining such geographical boundaries as may be necessary.</p><LI><p align="justify">

Specifying matters regarding the alteration and endurance of
   the general and Palestinian entities, if any, including
   opportunities and procedures for amendments, border
   adjustments, limitations on secession and emergency powers.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Drafting and ratifying a constitution, defining document, or
   compact.</p></ol><BR><p align="justify">



                        <H3><CENTER>Specific Options</CENTER></H3></p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>Option 1: Israel-Palestine Federation</H3></p><p align="justify">

This is the most orthodox federal solution.  It proposes the
creation of a Palestinian constituent state in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip which would be federated with Israel to create a
bi-state federation.  This solution requires a partnership
between separate peoples on the order of Czechoslovakia or
Yugoslavia but with the democracy characteristic of the United
States or Switzerland.  The principal dimensions of this option
are that it would be a conventional federation, consisting of one
general government uniting two constituent or federated states,
each with its own political institutions plus substantive powers
assigned and/or reserved from the list of critical functional
areas.  Both states would share in the federal government and
Jews and Arabs would have equal opportunity to reach and hold key
federal office.</p><p align="justify">

Those who would design such a federation should be aware of the
following critical issues:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

The federation would link the current State of Israel to a
   larger political body -- the federation -- with a sizable Arab
   population that is likely to grow further in absolute and
   proportional terms as a result of natural increase and
   possible immigration.
</p><LI><p align="justify">
 The Palestinians who agree to such an arrangement are likely
   -- at least in the short run -- to find themselves alienated
   from other Arab or Moslem states; thus the arrangement offered
   to the Palestinians would have to be sufficiently attractive
   to them to be worth the cost of political alienation that they
   must pay. This, in turn, may pose problems with regard to the
   Jewish character of Israel.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 In order to appeal to each of the major communities involved,
   the federation must allow each to retain links to respective
   diaspora communities.  Presumably, the Israeli partner will
   not forego its ties to world Jewry or the Jewish right of
   return.  In a federation where there is a presumption of
   equality among the entities, the Palestinians would demand
   similar provisions.
</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The burden of an Israel-Palestinian federation, in light of
   the above, is to provide ample measures of symbolic and
   tangible satisfactions to each entity in the context of what
   has been a history of sharp conflict between Zionism and
   Palestinian Arab nationalism.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 A two-state federation which must inevitably be based on full
   equality of the states to succeed, also works against Israel's
   desire to maintain its own Jewish identity.  It does nothing
   to deal with the "demographic problem" produced by the
   differential reproduction rates of the two peoples that is one
   of the most important reasons for Israel's willingness to
   concede any control over the territories and will remain of
   concern in any partnership with the Arabs.  It will either
   remain a threat or generate future conflicts if any kind of
   real or supposed population imbalance should result.  </p><LI><p align="justify">

 Such a federation would require drastic changes in Israel's
   present political system.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The status of Jerusalem would not be a problem under this
   arrangement since it could be established as a federal
   district and the seat of the federal government.  It could be
   the seat of the two state governments as well if it were so
   determined by each of them.</p></ol><p align="justify">

A federation is characterized by the fact that it creates a new
primary political entity, but in such a manner that the entities
which constitute it continue to maintain their respective
integrities.  The history of federalism shows that it takes two
to federate.  That is to say, if the federation is to have any
chance of success, both parties must be willing to accept the
ties between them in the proper federal spirit and have a strong
desire to live up to their provisions.  This does not seem to be
a realistic possibility under present conditions.  
</p><p align="justify">
Moreover, inequality in such arrangements can be tolerated when
the inequalities are more or less balanced or are dispersed among
a number of units (as is the case in the United States or
Canada). A federation of one strong and one weak unit can lead to
frustration and repression, or rebellion and war, particularly
when sharp ethnic and ideological differences are involved.</p><p align="justify">

Nor would a federation provide the symbolic satisfactions of
statehood that both Israelis and Palestinians seek.  Israeli Jews
are not about to give up their state and Palestinian Arabs insist
that they want something more than a piece of a federation.  </p><p align="justify">

It is in the very fact of the new primary entity that the
difficulties of federation of heterogeneous populations are to be
found.  Implicit in any primary political entity is some common
sense of nationhood, with all that it implies.  For a federation
to succeed, there must be proper objective encouragements (e.g.,
problems of common defense) and a will toward federation as well.
To summarize, historically, two-unit federations are particularly
difficult to maintain, especially where the units are unequal in
crucial ways and each unit serves a particular nationality.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 2: Israel-Palestine Confederation</H3></p><p align="justify">

The principal dimensions, critical functional areas, critical
issues and critical steps to be taken, are similar to those
involved in an Israel-Palestine federation.  However, in a
confederation, the constituent entities remain the primary
political units, and the general authority has only limited
federal derivative powers.  Indeed, postmodern confederations
have tended to rely on a network of specialized functional
authorities to link the member states rather than a single
general authority.  That way, it is possible to transfer full or
substantial powers in specific fields without opening the door to
encroachment on one overall authority of the confederate units.
Thus the specification of shared and reserved powers would leave
more in the hands of the entities and less in the hands of the
common authority or authorities.</p><p align="justify">

Those considering an Israel-Palestinian or
Israel-Jordan/Palestine confederation should think in terms of
two or three states, permanently bound within one general
authority or several joint functional authorities, which would be
assigned responsibilities for dealing with issues common to both.
Its assignments could include a minimum of functions, like
regulation of economic intercourse and land and water resources
between the two or three states.  It could include a somewhat
larger and more contentious list like foreign affairs and
defense; and it could include -- in the first instance or in time
-- more and more of the critical functional areas.</p><p align="justify">

No doubt the confederation would be constructed with the minimum
necessary responsibilities assigned to the general authority.
The rest would be in the hands of the constituent units.
Whatever the arrangement, it would be embodied in an appropriate
constitutional document.
</p><p align="justify">
Each state would be left the tasks of designing and
operating its own political institutions.  In this case, one
issue to be decided in negotiations would be the character of the
Palestinian Arab entity recognized as the constituent unit and
charged with the responsibility for establishing the permanent
institutions.  One major implication of this option is the
creation of a Palestinian Arab state, a step that, once taken,
would be well-nigh irrevocable no matter what the future of the
confederation itself.</p><p align="justify">

Properly worked out, a confederation could satisfy the symbolic
demands and resolve the demographic problems of both parties if
the will were there to resolve those problems.  In that respect,
this option offers far greater promise than federation.</p><p align="justify">

The problem of Jerusalem could be solved in a manner similar to
Option 1.  The city could be the seat of the institutions of the
confederation as well as the capital of one or both states.  The
capital district and holy places could come under joint rule of
the two states.</p><p align="justify">

The appeal of confederation is in its provision of greater
autonomy for the constituent units.  On the other hand, a
two-unit confederation would confront many of the same
difficulties as a two-unit federation, while a confederation of
three equal units would likely leave Israel in a permanent
minority position.  Also, no federation or confederation could
work unless all its constituent units were governed
democratically or at least in a republican manner.
</p><p align="justify">
In practice, the federation-confederation distinction may not
long survive in practice.  Other than the consensus embodied in
the constitution of the confederation, there are no clear
standards to keep the architects from assigning more or less of a
certain function to the general authority or the states; or to
keep subsequent leaders from amending the structure to a shape
that is more or less centralized in its allocation of powers.
Nor, for that matter, would it be easy to prevent one unit from
seceding, other than through the use of force, which, in the
context of the Middle East, might well provoke outside
intervention.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 3: A Federation of Multiple Jewish and Arab Cantons</H3></p><p align="justify">

Under this arrangement, Eretz Israel/Palestine west of the
Jordan, plus the Golan would be divided into a number of cantons,
united under a common general government, each of which (1) would
be more or less autonomous and (2) have either a Jewish or Arab
majority.  No less than six nor more than twelve cantons should
be considered, with the proper ratio to be two-thirds of the
cantons dominated by Jewish majorities and one-third Arab.  This
would more or less reflect the population balance and allow for
increases in population in both the Jewish and Arab cantons
without disturbing the overall federal balance.  So, for example,
under a six-canton arrangement, the Jewish cantons could consist
of the Galilee, the central coast, the Jewish settled portions of
the central interior, and the Negev, while the Arab cantons would
consist of the West Bank and Gaza.  </p><p align="justify">Under a nine-canton system,
Judea, Samaria and Gaza would each be separate cantons with Arab
majorities, while the Jewish cantons could be based on the six
existing administrative districts of the Ministry of Interior,
more or less, plus the adjacent Golan, which would lessen the
chances for the Galilee to shift from Jewish to Arab control.</p><p align="justify">
Under a twelve-canton arrangement, it would be possible to carve
out an additional Arab canton in the Western Galilee, thereby
granting the growing Arab population in that part of the country
greater autonomy.  The eight Jewish cantons could be divided more
or less on the basis of population and territorial and geographic
features.</p><p align="justify">

A cantonal plan such as this would require a drastic internal
change in Israel's political system in the sense that the single
Jewish state would be transformed into several constituent
entities, each with greater or lesser internal autonomy for
domestic purposes.  These cantons would be given substantial
local autonomy, particularly in the educational, cultural,
religious and social spheres under a clear constitutional
arrangement which could range from a fully federal one (as in
Switzerland where the cantons are the basic units of domestic
government) to a substantially decentralized system based on
federal principles but still unitary in the locus of final
authority) as in the Netherlands where the provinces are still
subject to substantial national government control.  The latter
would probably not give the Arabs a sufficient feeling of
self-government to encourage them to accept the plan, while the
former probably would seem too fragmented for the Jews.  On the
other hand, both extremes have advantages in dealing with
internal divisions which exist within the Jewish and Arab
populations of the country.</p><p align="justify">

The general government under this arrangement would have to allow
substantial opportunities for an Arab role, and would have to
become less clearly Jewish as a result.  On the other hand, there
is a long history of compromises in the Middle East with regard
to the constitutional division of offices on a communal or
sectarian basis which could be used to devise a plan for power
sharing.  So, too, with the division of functions.  It is fair to
conclude that those functions having to do with cultural and
religious matters would be principally in the hands of the
cantons, which would be free to provide special status for the
dominant communities within them, and to develop relations with
the other cantons of their community plus the members of their
community outside the boundaries of the state.</p><p align="justify">

For Jews, this might require giving the Jewish Agency renewed
importance as a non-state instrumentality for promoting Jewish
unity.  This would go against the Israeli tendency toward
centralization of authority which is problematic in the Israeli
political system in any case.  At the same time, it might be very
useful in developing even stronger ties between Israel and the
Jewish people.  That is to say, the Jewish people could be tied
more firmly to the Jewish cantons in institutionalized ways than
they can be to a single Jewish state functioning as the sole
repository of political sovereignty in the international arena.
The same is true with regard to the Arabs in connection with the
Palestinian diaspora or other Arab communities.  In a very real
sense, this state would be predicated, not only on the existence
of two nations within its boundaries, but on the ties between the
portions of those nations within the state's boundaries and the
portions outside.</p><p align="justify">

A major "plus" of the cantonal plan is that it can be implemented
unilaterally within the boundaries that Israel chooses to fix for
itself, once even the slightest agreement on the part of the
Arabs involved is obtained.  Provision can be made for
constituent assemblies in each canton, with cantons being
maintained as centrally administered territories until such
constituent assemblies meet, and with a common constitution or
basic law drawn up for the whole country at an appropriate time.
On the other hand, it should be quite clear that no such solution
can be simply imposed on the Arabs; there has to be sufficient
consent on their part.  Such consent would give them the autonomy
associated with federated (as distinct from sovereign) statehood,
at the price of living within a polity that will be dominated by
Jews.</p><p align="justify">

Under this arrangement, Jerusalem would either be divided among
Jewish and Arab cantons or would become a federal district and
the seat of the federal government.</p><p align="justify">

Those who would design a federation of multiple Jewish and Arab
cantons will have to take the critical steps specified at the
beginning of this chapter.  They should also be aware of the four
critical issues identified at the beginning of this chapter, plus
the additional controversy to be expected within the Jewish
community over the issue of the division of the Jewish state.
Particular care must be paid to the symbolic issue of dividing
nations among several states, as well as to such tangible
problems as:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

 Creating an additional layer of officialdom -- that of the
   quasi-autonomous canton -- for a Jewish population already
   burdened by an expensive and cumbersome bureaucracy.  It is
   possible that the change of governmental structure required in
   moving toward multiple cantons would present an opportunity
   for a massive reorganization of the various ministries toward
   more efficient formats.  However, it is also possible that the
   product would just be additional cumbersome bureaucracies
   within the cantons, added to essentially unchanged state
   ministries.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Creating an additional arena of policy makers, including
   perhaps elected cantonal officials to be added to the present
   municipal and general policy-making arenas.  The whole set
   of elected policy makers may be more than is necessary for a
   small state, and may further lengthen and obfuscate the
   procedures for dealing with subsequent policy issues.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The division of Israel into cantons will raise thorny problems
   of how to divide responsibility for the critical functional
   areas between the general authority and the cantons.  Related
   to this issue there will be questions concerning the division
   of existing debt and the subsequent division of taxation among
   the cantons; and issues of tax equity and equality of service
   benefits between the cantons that are not so evident (on a
   geographical basis) in the present unitary state.</p></ol><p align="justify">

What of the demographic situation?  Even with free movement of
population among regions and the difference in Jewish and Arab
rates of reproduction, it is unlikely that the population balance
would be altered within more than one canton under either system.
Thus the Jewish character of the greater part of the federation
would be assured while the Arab character of all areas with heavy
concentrations of Arabs would be equally protected.  On the other
hand, if the Arab population should come to equal or surpass the
Jewish population in the country as a whole -- a distinct
possibility if a significant number of the Palestinian refugees
are allowed to settle in the Arab cantons -- then a two to one
cantonal division reflected in the operation of the federal
government to preserve Jewish dominance will become untenable.</p><p align="justify">

It may be argued that Israel is too small for a quasi-federal
division of such complexity.  In fact, the present cease fire
lines give Israel an area two-thirds the size of Switzerland or
the Netherlands.  Moreover, the total population of the polity
would be at least 5.5 million, not significantly less than
Switzerland's static 5.9 million and is, in fact, nearly double
the total population of the United States at the time it adopted
its federal constitution.</p><p align="justify">

Even more important, the size and population of the several
cantons works out well.  It can be assumed that any canton of
over 300,000 people is politically and administratively viable.
This minimum figure could be reached even under the twelve canton
system. Moreover, under either of the systems there could be
sufficient balance in area, population, and resources among the
regions, both Jewish and Arab, to prevent any single region from
dominating the federation.</p><p align="justify">

While precise details as to the form of government to be used in
such a political system would have to be worked out by the
parties involved, a few general principles must be accepted as
the basis for negotiations.  There must be a constitutional
allocation of powers between each governmental plane (e.g.,
foreign affairs and defense to the general government, religion
to the regional governments) with some powers shared concurrently
by both.  The institutions of the general government should be
designed to protect both the national rights of the majority
people and the integrity of the minority people, as well as the
civil rights of all individuals.  A bicameral legislature would
probably be most appropriate with the cantons represented equally
in one house and according to population in the other.  </p><p align="justify">

Legislation could be initiated in either house and would have to
be approved by both.  The president and the executive council
would be chosen by both houses sitting in joint session, the
former for a fixed term and the latter either for a fixed term or
for as long as it has the confidence of both houses.  It would
function as the federal cabinet and its members could be drawn
from either house.  Where the general government exercises its
concurrent powers, every consideration should be given to
decentralizing their administration to the cantonal governments.</p><p align="justify">

The cantons would have legislative and administrative organs of
their own to enable them to carry out their responsibilities and
properly represent their people. Within the limits of the
constitutional guarantee of a republican form of government for
each, the cantons should have considerable flexibility in
creating and adopting their governmental institutions including
those of local government, in light of local circumstances.</p><p align="justify">

The judicial system should combine general and regional concerns
with local judges appointed from among local residents.  The
supreme court should have the power to decide questions arising
from distribution of powers among the several jurisdictions.</p><p align="justify">

Provisions could be made for intercantonal cooperation in
achieving common objectives that would allow the several Jewish
and Arab cantons to institutionalize collaboration among
themselves where policy would dictate its advisability.  Thus,
for example, the national aspects of educational policy and
administration could be transferred by the cantons to separate
intercantonal authorities for Jews and Arabs or to a federal
ministry of education with two divisions.</p><p align="justify">

Once the plan is promulgated, representatives in each canton
could assemble when ready to form a government and petition for
recognition as an autonomous canton within Israel. The dual
national aspects of the plan could even be implemented in the
beginning by giving the Israeli Arabs their regional government
under the twelve region system while encouraging the Arabs of the
territories to move in the same direction. Moreover, the plan
could be implemented without recourse to states outside of the
area of Israeli control, whether Jordan, Egypt or Syria.  Israel
could act with a minimum of outside interference to resettle the
Arab refugees and give the Arabs meaningful citizenship with real
self-government.</p><p align="justify">

The greatest drawback of this plan is the almost complete lack of
symbolic satisfaction for the Palestinians whose cantons, no
matter how powerful, would not have the international status or
image of an independent state.  Moreover, many Israelis would
feel that Israel was endangering itself through such a radical
decentralization.  On the other hand, the religious issue could
be diffused under such a system by entrusting policies regarding
the public exercise and support for religion to be handled by the
cantons.</p><p align="justify">

This plan could possibly have worked in the years between 1967
and 1973 when the Arabs in the territories were still fragmented
by regional and local identities and the old notables had the
requisite authority.  It is almost impossible to conceive of its
implementation today.  The Arabs would not accept it, even if the
Jews would, which also is unlikely.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 4: A Palestinian Arab State (or Entity) Associated With
Israel</H3></p><p align="justify">

Under such an arrangement, the portion of the territories not
directly annexed by Israel would be constituted into one or more
self-governing entities, with all the requisite internal
institutions of governance, but constitutionally linked or
associated with Israel in some specific and binding manner.</p><p align="justify">

While there are certain general patterns common to federacy and
associated state federalism, the very nature of the arrangement
permits a wide variety of formulations offering many possible
options for accommodating special local circumstances.  At the
same time, because of the newness of these forms in all but a
handful of special cases, it is still unclear as to whether or
not they simply represent a transitional phase on the way toward
full incorporation, in some manner, or full separation.  </p><p align="justify">

On the other hand, even this ostensible drawback may offer real
advantages to both Israel and the Palestinians, if their
desire is to create a short term framework that will provide the
latter with the viable option of self-government while allowing
the former to maintain necessary security controls, leaving
the long-range future of the relationship between the parties
open to alteration.  In essence, it provides for immediate
institutionalization of a mutually beneficial arrangement without
closing the door to future developments in several possible
directions. No doubt Israel will insist that this be a federacy
rather than an associated state arrangement, that is to say, that
any subsequent changes that might occur would have to be by
mutual agreement and that unilateral changes would be forbidden.</p><p align="justify">

Under this arrangement Israel itself would remain politically
intact and unchanged.  It would continue to control all foreign
affairs, defense and security arrangements for the entire
territory with the free federated state of the Palestinians
gaining internal autonomy in all other political, administrative,
judicial and cultural matters under very limited general
oversight (perhaps primarily judicial) of the Israeli government.
Since the Palestinians will elect their own legislature, they
will not vote for members of the Knesset.  At the same time, they
should be entitled to send one or more non-voting delegates to
participate in Knesset deliberations on matters pertaining to
them.</p><p align="justify">

Under this option, a special plan would have to be devised for
Jerusalem which we can assume Israel would insist on retaining in
its entirety.  On the other hand, the capital of the Palestinian
entity could be located within the city with an appropriate
status.</p><p align="justify">

This plan can be implemented whenever the Palestinians themselves
are ready to take the steps necessary to constitute such a state,
after which the necessary constitutional arrangements can be
worked out between them and the Israeli government.  It has the
great advantage of providing as much or more self-government for
the Palestinians as any of the other plans while least changing
the Israeli status quo, particularly in connection with Israel's
security interests and the Jewish character of the state.
Moreover, there is simple precedent for its successful
implementation since similar arrangements have evolved for
similar reasons -- namely, the necessity for autonomy based on
cultural differences within an overall political situation where
both separation and full federation of equals is precluded -- in
other parts of the world.</p><p align="justify">

The difficulties with this plan are the same as those described
in connection with any of the others.  First there is the problem
of obtaining Arab cooperation.  Moreover, despite all the
benefits of this form of political association, some real
concessions are required from Israel. First and foremost, once a
Palestinian Arab entity is created in any or all of the
territories involved, it will be a new and permanent fact of
life.  Then there are the special problems of size and proximity.
Even though Israel would be the dominant partner in the
association, it would be closer in terms of population, size, and
geography to the other entity than is the case in any existing
example of federacy.  (Most existing examples are islands
physically separated from the federate power, often by
considerable distance.)  Finally, the likelihood of an
irredentist movement, which may arise from a combination of
groups within the territories and from neighboring countries, may
transform this option into a vehicle for the expression of more
radical demands.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 5: Israel-Jordan Confederation with the Palestinian Arabs
Incorporated into Jordan</H3></p><p align="justify">

Similar critical issues and critical steps, including the
distribution of similar critical functional areas as were
specified in relation to Israel-Palestine federation in Option 1
above would have to be taken in relation to any proposal for an
Israel-Jordan confederation, taking into account that the
confederal nature of the proposal assumes greater powers assigned
to Israel and Jordan and lesser to the general authorities.  In
other words, the confederation itself would be weaker than its
Israeli and Jordanian constituent states, but it would have to
have at least some common political institutions with some
substantive powers.</p><p align="justify">

The following points ought to be considered by those attracted to
a proposal for an Israel-Jordanian confederation with the
Palestinians incorporated into Jordan:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

 The constitutional linkage of a pluralistic, competitive and
   frequently contentious democracy with a near-absolute
   monarchy.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The lack of precedent for a successful confederation involving
   populations so different on the several dimensions of culture,
   religion, and political institutions.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The permanent linkage of Israel with an even larger number of
   Arabs, which may bring about an Arab majority in the
   confederation within a relatively short time.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The status of Jerusalem could be resolved by making it the
   seat of the confederation authorities, perhaps with some part
   of it given special status as a federal district.</p></ol><p align="justify">

On the other hand, the appeal of a confederal agreement between
Israel and Jordan -- presumably with free access of the
populations to each part of the confederation -- might lessen the
problems of defining precise boundaries within the larger
confederation, and would avoid the problem (for Israel) of a
distinct Palestinian entity.  This, of course, would make it
undesirable in the eyes of most Palestinians.</p><p align="justify">

Another version of this option would be the establishment of a
binding league linking the two states, something less than a
confederation in comprehensiveness but equally binding in its
more limited sphere.  Such a league could be based on a common
market and security community plus certain common technical
functions.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 6: Israel-Jordan Confederation with a Palestinian Entity
Federated with One or the Other</H3></p><p align="justify">

This proposal is similar to Option 5 except that federal
relations -- with the attendant political institutions and
division of critical functional areas -- would be developed for
an Israel-Palestine or a Jordan-Palestine federation within the
outlines of the larger confederation.</p><p align="justify">

In this case, the following issues will require careful
consideration, in addition to those outlined in 5a-5c above:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

 The additional problems of border definition involved with
   three rather than two constituent entities.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 The additional layer of institutions that may facilitate
   intrigue, the confusion of the population, and delay in the
   formulation and execution of policy objectives.</p><LI><p align="justify">
 The creation of an explicitly Palestinian entity may encourage
   irredentism.</p></ol><p align="justify">

On the other hand, this would go far to solve the Palestinians'
need for their own entity and would diffuse the demographic
problem for Israel.  It would also make possible the redrawing of
the borders west of the river to provide for Israel's minimum
security needs, still allowing the vast majority of the
Palestinian Arab population to be out from under Israeli rule.</p><p align="justify">

While no doubt this arrangement logically would seem to be best
if there were a Jordanian-Palestinian federation confederated
with Israel than the other way around, the second possibility
should not be ruled out entirely.  As long as Jordan is under
Hashemite rule, the Palestinians might prefer a stronger link
with Israel.</p><p align="justify">

The problem of Jerusalem would be solved by making it the seat of
the confederation.  If the Palestinian entity were to be
federated with Israel, it could also be the federal capital for
both and the seat of government of the Palestinian entity as
well.  If the Palestinian entity were to be federated with
Jordan, some arrangement could be made to enable it to give its
seat in Jerusalem some special status.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 7: Israeli Incorporation of the Territories with an
Internal Consociational Arrangement on a Constitutional Basis</H3></p><p align="justify">

<H3>Option 8: A Totally Non-Territorial Consociational Federation
Within the Entire Area</H3></p><p align="justify">

These two options can be treated together because they would
closely coincide under any realistic effort to implement them.
What they would involve is the incorporation of the West Bank,
the Gaza Strip, and the Golan on a basis that would give either
the Arabs thus incorporated (Option 7) or all the Arabs on both
sides of the Green Line, including those already Israeli citizens
(Option 8) self-government for certain purposes on a
non-territorial basis, what has been termed consociationalism in
contemporary political science.</p><p align="justify">

Consociational arrangements can range from sharp separation of
functions among the consociational constituents to situations in
which the constituents are represented in proportion to their
numbers or interests in functions that are managed or
administered in common, or some combination of both.  Under such
arrangements, the population of Israel would be divided according
to community -- Jewish, Muslim, Christian plus smaller
communities, or Jewish, Arab, and Druse plus small communities -
there are several possible variations.  These communities would
have the authority to function as communities in matters of
religion, culture and education, with appropriate institutions to
provide for the carrying out of the functions assigned to each,
and appropriate means of raising or obtaining the revenues to
carry out those functions.  The general government of the
state would be so organized as to provide for the representation
of each community as such, and the participation of its members
in the governance of the state as a whole.</p><p align="justify">

Under such an arrangement, for example, the principal offices of
the government might include some formula for their division
among the several communities.  In all likelihood, it would be
desirable to add a second chamber to the Knesset for the
representation of the communities, with powers that might range
from simply consultative to real. Ministries would have to be
reorganized to provide for communal representation where
necessary or appropriate.</p><p align="justify">

This might require different classes of citizenship, a position
that is generally rejected out of hand as unequal and
undemocratic.  In fact, just about every country has different
classes of citizens.  Even the United States, which takes the
most egalitarian possible view of citizenship, has at least seven
classes of citizenship in practice: 1) regular citizens who are
citizens of both their state of residence and the United States
and who vote for both state and federal officials; 2) citizens
who reside in the District of Columbia, who vote for President of
the United States, have a non-voting representative in Congress,
and vote for local officials but are not fully represented in
Congress and cannot elect their own state officials; 3) citizens
who reside in Puerto Rico, the Northern Marianas, and the
territories, who vote for state and local officials but cannot
participate in federal elections; 4) Indians who live on
reservations, who in addition to voting for federal, state, and
local officials in the states in which their reservations are
located, vote for their tribal officials; 5) Americans living
abroad who have rights of citizenship, some of whom can vote by
absentee ballot in whatever elections they are entitled to vote
according to categories 1-4 and some of whom cannot, depending on
the laws of their respective states; 6) Americans living abroad
who do not maintain residences in the United States and cannot
vote in any American elections; 7) American citizens who live in
unincorporated territories (e.g., Guam and the Virgin Islands)
who can vote in local elections but have no share in federal
elections of any kind.  There are also resident aliens who live
in the United States, must pay taxes, and serve in the United
States army if called up, but who cannot vote.</p><p align="justify">

Each of these classes of citizenship presents its own form of
relating people to territory and government.  Israel might have
to develop a variety of relationships that fit its own situation.
For example, in line with the permanency of peoples and the
transience of political boundaries, Israel and the other states
of western Asia normally allow permanent residents of their
cities to vote in municipal elections whether or not they are
citizens of the state.</p><p align="justify">

Such arrangements would allow Israel to keep clear and undiluted
control over all areas of the traditional land of Israel
presently in its hands, while at the same time providing for real
self-government on the part of the Arab minorities.  On the other
hand, it would involve Israeli absorption of all the Arabs in the
territories on the basis of equality, relying upon the
consociational structure to maintain the Jewish character of the
state over the long run.  The Palestinian Arabs would be able to
preserve their national aspirations, but without a state of their
own.  To the extent that statehood has become an indispensable
aspect of national self-determination, this would pose a problem.</p><p align="justify">

The problem of Jerusalem could easily be resolved since it would
be the capital of the entire state and could be the seat of the
consociational authorities as well.</p><p align="justify">

Those attracted to these options should take account of the
following critical issues:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

The need to make either arrangement appeal to the Palestinian
   Arabs of the territories and important external groups, Arab
   and non-Arab. In particular, there would be a need to avoid
   the appearance of a "solution" imposed unilaterally by Israel.</p><LI><p align="justify">

The lack of substantial experience with either of these
   options under the conditions which prevail locally minimizes
   the advice which experts can offer with respect to critical
   steps which are necessary, including the character of
   administrative or political structures needed, or the division
   of critical functions among the various administrative or
   political entities.  These problems of design and
   implementation might be especially severe in Israel because it
   is a welfare state offering a full range of social services
   and maintaining wide-ranging economic controls in a more or
   less centralized manner.  Communitarian consociationalism was
   easier in a simpler age, before the development of the
   pervasive state.  In contrast, the primary extant examples of
   these federal models -- the Netherlands and Switzerland --
   developed before the emergence of the modern social service
   state -- there the services developed slowly along with the
   integration of diverse populations, even serving as cement for
   their integration.</p><LI><p align="justify">

The option anticipates the absorption of a sizable and
   potentially restless minority with the potential of becoming a
   majority in due course, into an innovative entity, whose
   institutions have not been tested in any comparable setting
   other than Lebanon with respect to their ability to enforce
   controls or satisfy tangible and symbolic demands.</p></ol><p align="justify">

The only similar example of a consociational polity of this
character was Lebanon, prior to its civil war.  Lebanon's
experience is not reassuring, to say the least, and is an
excellent guide to the pitfalls inherent in the consociational
option.  Consociationalism seems to depend on a very delicate
balance among the consociating partners, a balance that combines
both demographic and ideological features.  If the system becomes
unbalanced for some reason, changes in demography, changes in
ideological commitment, or the introduction of some new and
disturbing element, it is likely to collapse.  In Lebanon the
collapse brought about an apparently unending civil war.  But
even in the Netherlands when the original pillars ceased to be
relevant to a substantial portion of the population, the
consociational system collapsed, albeit in a more friendly manner
that allowed reintegration of the polity along other lines.  In
the last analysis, except where it has been combined with
territorial federalism as in Switzerland or Austria,
consociationalism has been no more than an interim solution to
otherwise very threatening political and social cleavages.
Consociational arrangements taken alone have had a life of
approximately two generations, no more.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 9: Condominium -- Joint Israeli-Jordanian/Palestinian Rule
Over the Territories with the Local Authorities Attached to One
or the Other for Civil Purposes</H3></p><p align="justify">

Joint rule (condominium) would involve shared Israeli-Jordanian
authority over the territories as a whole, while different
regions or each municipal jurisdiction (local authority) could be
attached to either Israel or Jordan for civil purposes, according
to the choice of its population.</p><p align="justify">

Shared Israeli-Jordanian/Palestinian rule could be established
over the administered territories as part of an overall
settlement that recognizes the rights of both Jews and Arabs to
separate states in historic Eretz Israel/Palestine.  At the same
time they would share the area in which both have an important
stake.  This plan would keep the administered territories within
Israel's security orbit, while recognizing the Arabs' right to
political status there. The economic links between both banks of
the Jordan would be formalized, and local affairs would be left
in the hands of the local inhabitants.</p><p align="justify">

Under this solution, the territories as a whole would be placed
under joint Israeli-Jordanian/Palestinian administration, while
local administrative functions would be handled by the residents
of the territories.  Two ways of doing so suggest themselves.
Either Israeli and Jordanian civil jurisdiction could be divided
along municipal boundaries, with the inhabitants of each town and
village choosing the state to exercise civil governmental powers
over them, or contiguous municipalities could form regional
bodies or cantons that would then be attached to Israel or Jordan
for civil purposes as an intermediate arena to give more
visibility to the Palestinians and more security to the Israeli
settlements in the territories.</p><p align="justify">

Under the first option, all the Arab cities and townships on the
West Bank would no doubt choose to remain Jordanian
municipalities with substantial internal autonomy, while those in
the Gaza Strip would choose to be attached to Jordan, giving that
country a sea outlet of its own to the west.  The Jewish
settlements in the Etzion Bloc, the Samarian hill country, the
Jordan valley, the Samarian foothills, and those in and around
the Gaza Strip would form the basis for several regional councils
under Israeli jurisdiction or would be attached to existing
regional councils west of the pre-1967 "green line."  Kiryat Arba
(Jewish Hebron), Maale Adumim, Ariel, and other Jewish urban
settlements would become cities under Israel law and control.</p><p align="justify">

Governance of the residents of the territories would largely be
in the hands either of the municipal bodies or of agents of the
mother state located within the municipal boundaries.  Hence
there should be no special problems in connection with the
structures or the functions of those bodies.  Each state would
apply its own laws, administrative arrangements, and standards of
service within the municipalities attached to it.</p><p align="justify">

The vacant state lands could, in the main, pass under Israel's
control to give it added protection.  Jordan, in return, would be
given a formal presence and certain rights in Jerusalem,
especially over the Moslem holy places.  Other territory not
included within (or otherwise separated from) the boundaries of
existing towns or villages would be administered directly by the
condominium authority and opened to settlement by either Jews or
Arabs (perhaps including Palestinian refugees).  The creation of
new towns and villages based on differences in national
citizenship would be handled by Israeli and Jordanian authorities
through a set of procedures to be established by joint agreement.</p><p align="justify">

Another variant of this option would be to institute an
autonomous Palestinian administration in the territories, to
establish a condominium council to which it would be responsible,
and to set up other functional authorities on a bilateral
(Israel-Jordan or Israel-Palestinian) or a trilateral
(Israel-Jordan-Palestinian) basis to handle such general tasks.
The condominium council would be responsible for legislation,
overall planning and budgeting, and judicial functions.  It could
be composed of equal Israeli and Jordanian representation, with
the Palestinian Arabs guaranteed representation in the Jordanian
delegation.  Security, immigration, and citizenship issues could
be handled through a bilateral authority, and economic
development and resettlement of refugees through a trilateral
authority.  Israeli or Jordanian citizenship would be a matter of
individual choice, and municipal functions would be handled by
existing local authorities.</p><p align="justify">

Those who live in the territories -- and it is expected that they
will come to include an increasing number of Jews -- would be
able to choose as individuals between Israeli and Jordanian
citizenship.  At the same time, they could maintain or establish
self-governing local communities attached to the state of their
citizenship.  Such an arrangement has the advantage of avoiding
the problems of a separate Palestinian state or of incorporating
by fiat a million reluctant Arabs into an equally reluctant
Israel as full citizens.  It would allow the Palestinian Arabs
the full right to preserve their national identity and pan-Arab
connections, and it would not jeopardize the Jewish identity or
security of Israel.</p><p align="justify">

The technical tasks of effecting such an arrangement -- as
distinct from the political problems -- are not great.  The
condominium council would have a small staff to handle he
governmental functions entrusted to it.  The primary tasks of the
council would be coordinative, though it should also be empowered
to enact ordinances for the condominium area under conditions
established by the lawmaking bodies of the two states.  funds for
maintaining the condominium would come from the budgets of the
two states, and responsibility for them would be decided by
formula.  Residents of the territories would pay taxes to their
respective states of citizenship and to their municipal
governments, as would any other citizens.  If so determined, they
could pay a share of their state taxes directly to the
condominium authorities for internal use.</p><p align="justify">

The following five goals must be achieved by any workable plan
based on this approach:</p><ul><LI><p align="justify">
 demilitarization of the territories, with sufficient Israeli
  military control to guarantee Israel's security and perhaps a
  symbolic Jordanian military presence on the West Bank or even
  in time a joint command;</p><LI><p align="justify">
 substantially free movement of Jews and Arabs into and out of
  the territories, which should be open along present lines;</p><LI><p align="justify">
 the right of all residents of the territories to choose freely
  Israeli or Jordanian citizenship (which the Jordanians could
  define as Palestinian), and to live within a communal framework
  that gives that citizenship meaning;</p><LI><p align="justify">

 substantial economic integration of Israel, the territories,
  and Jordan;</p><LI><p align="justify">
 provision for solving the refugee problem by opening the
  territories to to at least some of those who wish to resettle
  in them.</p></ul><p align="justify">

This plan has many advantages and, using a little imagination,
would be workable.  Clearly, it requires the cooperation of
Jordan as well as the Palestinians.  Indeed, the involvement of
the Palestinians is necessarily contingent upon Jordanian
participation. Since the condominium plan offers Jordanians an
opportunity to return in some measure to all of the West Bank,
perhaps it will be persuasive.  The plan provides an opportunity
to solve the Palestinian question without establishing yet a
third small state within the original boundaries of the land of
Israel.  The involvement of Jordan in a permanent arrangement
would keep alive the traditional ties between the east and west
banks of the Jordan River, and it would protect Israeli security.
In sum, it is a workable program for a real solution if the
Palestinians will accept the expression of their desire for
statehood through Jordan or a Palestinian state whose center is
east of the Jordan River.</p><p align="justify">

The distinctive features of this option include:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

 Maximum flexibility.  Negotiators can choose to concentrate on
   changing substantive features of what is the status quo, or,
   more simply, make more explicit various of the arrangements
   that have already been worked out in practice with respect to
   joint administration of the territories or local autonomy
   within them.  This approach to federal-like arrangements
   invites bargaining on both tangible and symbolic issues, or
   some combination of the two.  It is susceptible to minimum or
   gradual changes in practice, with maximum change in
   appearance.</p><LI><p align="justify">

Related to this flexibility is the opportunity to vary the
   levels of Israeli, Palestinian, or Jordanian control -- or
   control placed in the hands of joint authorities or local
   authorities -- from one critical functional area to another.
   Security can be assigned largely to Israel, for example,
   education and welfare to the local authorities, and regulation
   of commerce could be assigned to one or more joint
   authorities.  Furthermore, the authorities may vary in the
   extent to which they are composed of Israeli, Jordanian or
   local representatives.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Arrangements need not be settled or made explicit once and for
   all time.  Various arrangements can be established for a
   limited time period -- requiring a formal act to extend or
   revise; others can be designed so that control gradually
   shifts from, say, Israeli to local or Jordanian hands; while
   some other functional areas may be set up in a manner that
   favors continuation of whatever division of authority is
   instituted (e.g., by requiring an extraordinary action like
   agreement of Israeli and Jordanian heads of state to amend the
   arrangement).</p><LI><p align="justify">

 The possibility of different arrangements for local areas
   inhabited by Arabs and those settled by Jews since 1967.</p></ol><p align="justify">

A principal feature of this option might be a variety of joint
authorities, each dealing with one or more of the critical
functional areas.  The multiplicity of authorities could have a
number of advantages:</p><ol type="a"><LI><p align="justify">

 It would be possible to tailor the authority responsible for
   each functional area to the peculiarities of geographical
   boundaries, citizen demand and Israeli-Jordanian-local control
   of the authority, as appears appropriate.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 Multiple institutions can produce an overlapping of
   commitments and loyalties to various webs of economic, social,
   and administrative interaction.  These may deter the
   development of clear and similar "we" vs. "they" alignments
   across all functional areas.  While an Israel vs. Jordanian
   and Palestinian alignment may occur in one authority, for
   example, the drift toward general hostility may be blunted by
   harmony in other authorities, or by various combinations of
   Israel and Jordanian vs. Palestinian, Israel and Palestinian
   vs. Jordanian, or by shifting alignments from issue to issue.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 With reference to the critical issues introduced in the
   beginning of this chapter, the option of multiple joint
   authorities would avoid the issues of explicitly linking a
   large and growing Arab population to Israel, or of
   establishing a Palestinian entity as such.</p><LI><p align="justify">

 In contrast with these appeals, however, the option of
   multiple joint authorities offers only minimum symbolic
   gratification to those Palestinian Arabs, Israeli
   annexationists, and others wanting simple and permanent
   solutions that have widespread political "sex appeal."  In
   this connection, its architects must pay special attention to
   the political appeals of the multiple joint authorities to
   Palestinians and others, like Americans and other Westerners
   who would test such arrangements against their own conceptions
   of a political settlement.  In order to satisfy such concerns,
   the joint authorities could offer opportunities for local
   elections in the territories.  These could select both the
   executives and council members of local authorities, as well
   as select local representatives to the joint Israeli-Jordanian
   authorities.  For some authorities, as indicated above, the
   local component of the membership might be sizable -- perhaps
   a majority.  Were steps like this taken, the architects of the
   joint authorities could legitimately claim to be preserving
   the economic and social benefits that have developed in the
   territories since 1967, while providing a measure of political
   freedom of expression that, in fact, is not available
   elsewhere in the Arab world.</p></ol><p align="justify">

There would be a need for a general authority with some capacity
to integrate the authorities dealing with functional areas.  This
general authority may be assigned functions ranging from simply
transmitting information about policies, performance, and citizen
response among the functional authorities, to a formidable set of
powers that may include overall planning and control over the
allocation of funds to the various functional authorities.  Such
a general authority could also be given a role in approving new
tax policies for the populations covered by the functional
authorities; approving and arranging for debt issues; or
establishing new functional authorities in response to demand.
The general authority itself must be designed with an eye toward
both political and administrative considerations.  The important
issues include the composition of its membership, their
selection, and the nature of its professional staff
(secretariat), if any, to aid the members in their tasks, and the
means of financing its activities.</p><p align="justify">

The appeal of this option is that it can be designed to take
advantage of the economic and administrative arrangements that
have evolved since 1967, and which have integrated the
territories economically with Israel as well as (or more than)
with Jordan.  To be sure, it will be no simple task to develop
and implement the political formulations that, on less emotional
terrain, would normally accompany those economic realities.
However, no one concerned with bringing about a political
solution with respect to the territories -- whether it be federal
or otherwise -- can overlook the economic integration that has
developed between Israel and the territories since 1967.  To make
political arrangements that run counter to these economic
realities would be to invite severe dislocations in the
territories.</p><p align="justify">

Condominium, or joint rule, has been used historically in
situations where the extreme territorial separation that lies at
the basis of the modern nation-state is not susceptible of
solving particular political problems.  Condominium may be
particularly helpful in solving political problems in the Middle
East, where fixed boundaries have traditionally been the
exception rather than the rule, and where the governance of
ethno-religious communities that extend across territorial
boundaries is a perennial problem.</p><BR>

<H3>Option 10: Various Partial or Sectoral Federal Arrangements Such
as a Customs Union, Common Market, or Joint Special-Purpose
Authorities Serving Two or Three States</H3></p><p align="justify">

This option does not require detailed description except to say
that its flexibility is sufficient to incorporate substantial
parts of most of the preceding options, and then some.  It is
consistent with federal arrangements between Israel and
Palestine, confederal relations between Israel and Palestine
and/or Jordan; or the formalization of some of the ongoing
practices that have evolved between Israel, Jordan and the
territories.  Furthermore, some of its features may invite wider
participation, as -- for example -- the inclusion of part or all
of what is now Lebanon plus Jordan and the territories, in a
common market or a special-purpose authority dealing with such
functions as water or electricity.  
</p><p align="justify">
As in Option 9 above, the shared decision-making that is
formalized can be made narrow or wide: ranging from the joint
development of a particular water resource, economic opportunity,
or religious site; common efforts to promote tourism; the joint
administration of the Old City in Jerusalem; or the joint support
of institutes for economic planning, or research and development
in industry and agriculture.  Also as in Option 9, there might
be a provision for a general authority, with functions ranging
from providing officials of the various federal arrangements with
a forum for consultation and the exchange of information to the
more elaborate functions of controlling certain resources or
establishing new sectoral federal arrangements.</p><p align="justify">

Such limited joint projects as envisaged in this option may have
special appeal in the beginning stages of formalized cooperation,
insofar as negotiations and implementation can lead to the actual
delivery of benefits to each side without facing or foreclosing
options on the difficult matters of overall boundaries, the
design of political institutions, or the division of the more
sensitive of the critical functional areas.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>Option 11: Bilateral Federal Arrangements With Different Kinds of
Links Between Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, or Jordan</H3></p><p align="justify">

This option offers additional flexibility beyond that in Options
9 and 10.  The initiative would lie with Israel to formulate
bilateral arrangements with one or several of the above partners,
with the area to be served varying with the arrangement at hand.
There may be one set of boundaries for an agreement on shared
planning and financing of economic development, for example, and
another set of boundaries for an agreement on water development
or the control of communicable diseases.  Likewise, the
institutional mechanisms to oversee the arrangement could vary
with the functional area.  For example, there might be a
committee of Israeli and local administrators charged with the
implementation of health regulations over a certain territory,
while Israeli Knesset members might serve on a joint commission
with locally elected representatives for economic development.</p><p align="justify">

A related feature of this option is the possibility of
negotiating with or without Jordan as a partner.  It thereby
frees Israeli negotiators from dependence on Jordanian
cooperation.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>                          A Final Point
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

The issue of Arab and world appeal would be crucial for the
success of any of these options.  It would not be necessary to
satisfy all or even most members of the world community with the
quality of Israel's offers, but for any option to be pursued
seriously it would require substantial correspondence to the
democratic traditions of Israel and other Western democracies.
That means that the parties to any arrangement would have to
genuinely consent to it and genuinely share in its
implementation.
