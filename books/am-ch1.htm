                   <H3><CENTER>The Importance of Location</CENTER></H3></p><p align="justify">

    There is a popular story about a man who returned to his home
to find an intruder hiding in his closet. Turning to the intruder
in outrage, the householder bellowed, "What are you doing here?"
The intruder, a meek little man replied, "Everybody has to be
somewhere." The truth of this truism should be so obvious that it
need hardly be stated. Recent efforts to explain human behavior,
however, have too often neglected or overlooked the factor of
location. Everybody does, indeed, have to be somewhere, and where
one is plays a crucial role in determining who and what one is
and what one does (or, in other words, how one behaves). What is
true of individuals is equally true of groups, societies, peoples
and nations. </p><p align="justify">
    Even when we do think of location, we tend to think of it
simply as a spatial matter--as a matter of being some place. In
fact, location has three critical dimensions: spatial, temporal,
and cultural. All human beings and groups are located in a
particular space, in a particular time, and in a particular
culture. It is necessary to understand all three facets of
location in order to understand how people behave and why they
behave as they do. It is not sufficient to think of the United
States as being geographically located between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, bounded by Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico on the
south and Canada on the north. It is also necessary to understand
that the United States is historically located in the modern
epoch that opened at the beginning of the 17th century and
culturally located within what we generally term western
civilization. As a result of the first, it has no premodern
history of political consequence which does much to explain its
difficulty in understanding the driving forces behind "old world"
societies that have to modernize. As a result of the second, it
has been able to focus cultural inheritance particularly
conducive to the development of an energetic, even aggressive,
competitive entrepreneurial society. All of these are crucial
bench marks for focusing in upon the location of any particular
element in the United States and for understanding the behavior
of its people and its political system.</p><p align="justify">
    Biologically, humans are tied to all three locational
dimensions. People, in common with all other animals, are
severely bounded by time, which, like space, they can manipulate
only to a certain degree. People live in particular times and
each person is allotted a particular measure of time. Living in
particular times means that people begin their lives with an
inheritance of times gone by and must maneuver within their own
times in light of the limitations and possibilities imposed by
what has gone before. In the case of one's own time span, a
person may extend or contract his or her life expectancy
partially through his or her efforts (e.g., by eating or smoking
habits) and may determine how time is used within very real
limits.</p><p align="justify">
    In any given period people are constrained by the limits of
knowledge and the habitual practices available at that particular
time. There is also a sense in which time runs out before people
become aware of potential dangers, before new knowledge can be
developed to meet new problems, or before individuals, statesmen
and societies can complete new projects. We do not, for example,
have sufficient knowledge to make solar energy economically
viable now or enough technical skill available to make nuclear
energy comfortably safe, especially with regard to radioactive
wastes. As the same time, the "spirit of our time" calls for a
continuing increase in the use of energy in order to maintain
the style of life to which Americans have become culturally
accustomed. The domestic and international political problems
raised by worldwide energy needs became apparent during the
1970s. While that immediate crisis was overcome, the larger
issue remains with the American people as the world moves toward
the twenty-first century.</p><p align="justify">
    In another vein, we often speak of the frustrations and
opportunities that arise for individuals or groups who are
"behind the times" or "ahead of their time." Political reformers
especially experience the latter feeling, while regarding others
as being "behind the times." Finally, in terms of day-to-day
political life, the timing of action in one of the most important
skills of a successful political leader.</p><p align="justify">
    In recent years, intensive investigations have been made into
human territoriality (the human need to have ties to a particular
place). They have demonstrated that all living beings have such a
need which shapes their orientations toward space. While humans
have greater opportunities to maneuver than animals, there are
limits to the degree to which they can manipulate their
territorial instincts, even as they organize and reorganize space
to meet their needs with varying degrees of effectiveness.</p><p align="justify">
    Political boundaries represent one major way in which people
seek to organize space for their use. Territorial boundaries,
whether they be national boundaries or household property lines,
sort people out in space so as to help minimize conflict and
aggression and organize competition and cooperation among people.
The political importance of territory is heightened by the
universal tendency of individuals and like-minded individuals to
differentiate themselves from one another. Territory helps to
provide individuals and groups with a sense of security and with
a place in which they can work out their own identities and
destinies. We might also keep in mind the fact that individuals
occupy multiple territories -- from personal space, to household,
neighborhood, village or city, county, state, region, section,
nation, continent, hemisphere and perhaps even planet. Each of
these "places" has different meanings and different purposes for
people. In at least one respect, then, politics can be understood
as the way on which humans impose their own order upon both space
and time, which are otherwise differentiated only by natural
processes or characteristics. That order is imposed, first and
foremost, through human culture.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    In its simplest sense, culture may be regarded as the "way of
life" of a people. The concept of culture refers to the explicit
and implicit or overt and covert patterns of shared beliefs,
values and traditions about life held by a particular people. It
consists of a set of rules, common symbols and common sentiments
which are learned by individuals as they grow up within the
group. In this way culture tends to become "second nature"
affecting behavior without self-conscious reflection. Culture
separates humans from animals. Anthropologists have taught us
that all people, groups, and societies are located within
particular cultures whose own basis is so intertwined with man's
biological base that it is impossible to draw any precise or even
imprecise line separating the two. We are all inheritors of a
culture which we can, to some degree, continue to shape but which
is, in some respects, as much beyond the reach of our influence
as the land forms upon which we live or the inexorable march of
time from the beginning to the end of our lives.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Political culture can best be understood in terms of the
framework it sets for individual and group political behavior --
in the political thoughts, attitudes, assumptions, and values of
individuals and groups and in the range of permissible or
acceptable action that flows from them. Political culture as
such, directly determines behavior in relatively few situations
or in response to relatively few particular issues.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT> Instead, its
influence lies in its power to set reasonably fixed limits on
political behavior and to provide subliminal direction for
political action in particular political systems. These limits
and direction are all the more effective because of their
antiquity and subtlety, whereby those limited are often unaware
of the limitations placed upon them.</p><p align="justify"><BR>

</H3></p><p align="justify">
</CENTER>
<H3>Some General Propositions About Culture
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    The study of political culture is related to the study of
culture as a whole. Consequently, we shall begin our exploration
with some propositions about the nature of culture as a whole.
Culture refers to a way of life combining a totality of
experience. Referring to culture as a "way" of life highlights
its dynamic character; every culture is located in a particular
time and space. Indeed, the handling of time and space are major
concerns of every culture. Significantly, culture is based on
communication (a term related to communis, "common") which
involves sharing "ways" of perception and understanding within a
community.</p><p align="justify">
    It is equally significant that the term culture is related to
cultivation, for culture is, in the last analysis, learned
behavior. Culture is more than custom; it is a way of thinking,
feeling, and believing that is not only learned but involves
selective learning. Yet, culture is so much a part of man's life
that it can be best understood as second nature. It is the aspect
of his behavior that man takes for granted, believing it to be
universal (if it is part of his culture) or idiosyncratic (if it
is part of another's). Culture, like nature, is at least partly
concealed. It is almost a truism that nay particular culture is
most concealed from those who share in it. People must make a
particular effort to understand their own culture precisely
because all cultures are both explicit and implicit (in Clyde
Kluckhohn's terms) or overt and convert (in Ralph Linton's).</p><p align="justify"> 
    In his thought-provoking book The Silent Language, the
anthropologist Edward Hall sees culture as having three
manifestations; formal, informal, and technical.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT> According to
Hall, a culture's formal manifestations are to be found in its
implicit rules; the core of culture is second nature. Its
informal manifestations represent learned behavior that has
passed out of the awareness of those who have been acculturated
into it, while the technical manifestations of a culture are
those found at the highest levels of consciousness. Hall's
formulation is particularly useful in developing an understanding
of political culture which, by its very nature, generates
subconscious patterns of political behavior.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


                 <H3>The Biological Basis of Culture</H3></p><p align="justify">

    It has become increasing recognized that culture has a
biological basis. Culture channels biological processes and
modifies biological functioning. For example, "territoriality"
which as been shown to have biological roots, has been culturally
transmuted into such diverse manifestations as the migratory
range of nomadic tribes on the Asian steppes, the thrust toward
ownership of detached, single-family dwellings in the United
States, and the drive for "Lebensraum" (living space) on the part
of the German Reich in the twentieth century.
    The development from biological demands to culture can be
simply portrayed in the following manner:</p><p align="justify">

   <CENTER> biological demands---------infrastructure------------culture</CENTER></p><p align="justify">

Each culture shapes the biological demands of its members in its
own particular image, establishing a "social heredity" and
thereby uniting nature and culture (although there is no general
agreement as to the relative strength of nature and culture in
shaping behavior).</p><p align="justify">
    Theoretically, it is possible to isolate the "natural"
components behind culture but, as much as they may reveal about
mankind in general, unmodified, these natural components reveal
little about particular human beings or groups. In these respect,
the Greek idea of "nature" which implies an underlying pattern of
behavior fixed by the cosmos for every species is less useful for
understanding man as a social being than the Hebrew idea of "way"
which implies that each group as well as each species moves (or
develops) within a context that combines biological and cultural
aspects into a single individual package. Such phenomena as
cities, architecture, myths, and ideologies create sensory
screens through which men live in and perceive the world among
them. Similarly, sight, sound, and smell are biological devices
that regulate cultural perceptions even as they are, themselves,
culturally attuned in particular directions. Hence different
cultures create different kinds of visual, auditory, and
olfactory space for those who are within them. </p><p align="justify"><BR>


                      <H3>Language and Culture</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Although culture involves both verbal and nonverbal
communication, language is man's "program" through which he
registers and structures external reality; hence language is a
major element in the creation of different sensory worlds and the
formation of thought. Political language is a major factor in the
formation of political thinking even in its most elementary
forms. Political culture differences often are reflected in
different political terminologies, while different subcultures
within the same overall political culture frequently infuse the
same terminologies with differences in meaning. Every political
culture has its own special political terms (such as open
primary, public servant, nonpartisanship, good government,
American way of life in the American culture) with their special
meanings that are not transferable to any other culture.
Similarly, what are to us common political terms such as
democracy, freedom, the people, and politics, have special
meanings in different political cultures if they exist within
them at all. Any or all of these terms will have different shades
of meaning in the various subcultures within a particular
political culture.</p><p align="justify">
    "Define your terms" is a favorite intellectual game, often
played with these or similar words. Sooner or later we all learn
that for some terms every precise definition begets a different
and equally precise one. This is a reflection of the difficulties
of definition even within the same culture. In fact, such terms
are actually value concepts that are infused with meaning through
the culturally defined imagery which they provoke within the
minds of those who use them, not because of any agreement as to
their precise definition. Value concepts are terms whose use
evokes importance in shaping the attitudes and beliefs of the
participants in that culture. As terms, their meaning is
connotative or suggestive; precise definitions invariably fail to
convey their full meaning, no doubt because value concepts get at
the heart of a culture and therefore must be as dynamic as the
culture itself, while full definition actually denies them their
fullness.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT> One of the keys to understanding a particular culture
is the identification and understanding of its value concepts.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


                <H3>Culture, Society, and Personality
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, another anthropologist, sees culture
as having three aspects: a set of rules (both counsels and
precepts), common symbols -- necessary for communication -- with
common meanings attached to those symbols, and common sentiments.
In this connection, it is important to note the distinction
between culture and society (in the largest sense). "Society" may
be defined as an organized group of people who interact more
with each other than they do with other people, cooperating with
one another for the attainment of certain ongoing ends, while
"culture" may be defined as the distinctive way of life of any
society produced by shared experiences filtered through
culturally predetermined perspectives. Culture represent "the
organized repetitive responses of a society's members" (Linton)
or the force for the standardization of the behavior of
individuals and the "fitting together" of society
(Radcliffe-Brown). In sum, culture is the integrating factor in
society.</p><p align="justify">
    Just as culture is the integrating factor in society,
personality is the integrating factor in the individual. Culture
is the major determinant of basic personality structure;
different cultures develop different personality norms.
Socialization of personality traits leads cumulatively to the
development of specific-psychological biases in the culture of
the world.</p><p align="justify"><BR>

         <H3>Culture and Religion
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    At this point, it is important to note the extraordinary
influences of religion (broadly defined to include the so-called
secular religions of the modern world as well as the tradition
ones) on culture as creator and legitimizer or social and
political norms, patterns, and goals. Religion may well be the
major catalyst of cultural change. Strong historical evidence
assigns this role to religions or quasi-religious movements,
whether Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Communism in the West,
or Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto in the East. At the same
time, it seems that particular cultures. Why, for example, did
the Calvinist and Reformed churches become dominant in societies
that have adopted or experimented with federal modes of political
organization? Religion even plays a role in the creation and
diffusion of language and linguistic patterns, for example, the
role of Christianity, especially Protestant Christianity, with
its emphasis on reading the Bible, in spreading literacy and
certain value concepts first in Europe and more recently in Asia
and Africa.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


                     <H3>Culture and Subcultures</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The more complex the society, the more there are likely to be
subcultures within it. Subcultures represent the interaction of
nuances of differences within it. Subcultures represent the
interaction of nuances of differences within larger cultures,
separable to a degree but always within the framework of the
overall culture. The subtleties of subcultural variations add
spice to the study of political culture.
</p><p align="justify"><BR>

                   <H3>Cultural and Justice
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    A.R. Radcliffe-Brown has argued persuasively that all
societies are built around the integrating structural principle
of justice which he presents as culturally defined.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT>Justice
involves both just retribution and equivalent return (the law of
retaliation, the principle that benefits must be compensated for
by benefits, and indemnification for injury). Differences in the
conception of justice are rooted in cultural differences.</p><p align="justify">
    In this respect, at least, Radcliffe-Brown brings modern
social science around full circle to rediscover the architectonic
nature of politics accepted without questions by the Greeks. All
societies are ultimately civil, or political, societies because
they involve the development and maintenance of shared principles
of justice through accepted authoritative arrangements. The
shared principles of justice in a given society are, in large
measure, a function of its culture and, to a considerable degree,
of its political culture.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


<H3>Political Culture and Political Behavior
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    Political Culture may be defined, for our purposes here, as
the particular pattern of orientation to political action in
which each political system is imbedded. It is an element in
general culture that is separable for some purposes. The study of
political culture requires that distinctions be made regarding:
</p><p align="justify">
a. Sources of political culture, such as race, ethnicity,
religion, language and life experiences</p><p align="justify">
b. Manifestations of political culture, such as political
attitudes, symbols, and style</p><p align="justify">
c. Effects of political culture, such as actions, institutions
and policies
</p><BR>
<p align="justify">
<CENTER>*&nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;*</CENTER>
</p><BR><p align="justify">

              <H3>Religion, Culture and Political Life</H3></p><p align="justify">
    All signs point to religious movements -- those great surges
of human self-definition based on certain perceived transcendent
and enduring truths embodied within some institutional framework
--  as being the keys to cultural development and survival.
Religious movements have been central to cultural continuity and
the transmission of cultural modes to succeeding generations or
foreign populations, to transcending old ethnic or national
divisions or creating new ones, and to fundamental changes
within particular cultures leading to the emergence of new
cultures or subcultures. Culture is transformed through religious
experiences ranging from the Jews' experience at Mount Sinai to
the American Indians' ghost dance movement of the 1890s, from
the Protestant Reformation to the spread of Communism as a kind
of secular religion.</p><p align="justify">
    Although religious experiences may be generated by a host of
factors, once an experience takes hold among particular people,
it becomes a force promoting fundamental change and then
continuity. The potency of religion is reflected in the way that
it is found among all people in all times and places and in the
staying-power of particular importance to political thinkers,
whether that be Plato or Machiavelli attempting to use religion
as a way of cementing or changing the life of a polity; or Locke
trying to separate religion and politics by making religion a
private, voluntary affair; or Marx trying to "liberate" humanity
from the "false consciousness" induced by this "opium of the
people."</p><p align="justify">
    Three corollary points should also be noted. Specific
religious movements, even as they change culture, are generally
most successful among groups already culturally predisposed
toward their fundamental tenets. Thus, Calvinistic Protestantism
found its strength among peoples with a common cultural heritage
along the shores of the North Sea. Their American descendants
created Yankee Puritanism. Mormonism was founded by Yankees in
upstate New York (1830) during a period of religious ferment and
revival. It has had the most success in proselytizing among the
same peoples who were originally attracted to Calvinism plus the
Scandinavians who come from a similar cultural milieu.</p><p align="justify"> 
    Second, the impact of religion on society and politics is not
limited to the influence of those who formally participate in its
institutional manifestations. Instead, the approaches to life
embodied in particular religions tend to infuse culture as a
whole, thereby continuing to influence, however subtly, even
those who have formally strayed from the fold.</p><p align="justify"> 
    Third, a decline in the force of a particular pattern of
religious belief and experience within the culture it has molded
invariably leads to a cultural crisis of the first magnitude.
This usually leads to a search for religious substitutes to
overcome the crisis. The Roman Empire, for instance, underwent
such an experience after the first century of the Christian era,
and there are strong indications that the Western world is
experiencing a similar crisis today.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></p><P>

<BR>
<p align="justify">
<CENTER>*&nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;*</CENTER>
</p><BR><p align="justify">

    Political culture, qua political culture, can be studied only
through its manifestations.  To study the sources is not to study
the political culture itself.  Almond and Powell are quite
correct when they assert that: "Political culture is not a
residual explanatory category.  [That is to say, it is not
something that only explains what other factors cannot explain.]
It involves a set of phenomena which can be identified and to
some degree measured."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The manifestations of political culture may be broken down
for analytic purposes into at least two levels and two kinds of
patterns.  Just as there are two patterns of cultural
manifestations on the individual level, there are two kinds on
the community level.  Patterns of individual and community belief
are manifested in a variety of political symbols by which the
individual or the community as a whole expresses its values, its
self-understanding, its goals, etc. Similarly political style
involves community-wide patterns of action different from the
personal behavior of particular actors.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Political culture is not simply the aggregate of the four
component manifestations. In addition, we must consider the
various patterns of interaction among the four component parts.
Individual beliefs concerning the meaning of community symbols
and the meaning attached to those same symbols by the community
as a whole are also important aspects of the political culture.
Similarly, it is important for understanding political culture to
remember the disjunctures between community symbols and
individual beliefs on one hand and individual behavior and the
community's style of politics on the other.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


    <H3>Cultural Themes and Their Political Cultural Equivalents
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    Clyde Kluckhohn has posited six themes that must find
expression in every culture. As we have already seen in the case
of the first -- language -- these themes can be adapted to
suggest political cultural equivalents. By making the
adaptations, we are better able to define the potential scope and
content of the study of political culture. Aesthetic Expression,
Kluckhohn's second theme, embodies such elements of political
styles, individual and general, and their aesthetic appeal in
particular political cultures; changes in political style,
temporal and regional; political symbols and symbolization; and
what makes certain political styles or myths, traditional or
ideological, aesthetically appealing in particular political
cultures.</p><p align="justify">
    Standardized Orientation to the Deeper Problems of Life and
Death, the third theme, has its equivalent in questions of
political life and death. Political life can be understood as
referring to such questions as what is acceptable and desirable
for attaining office or acquiring political power. Hence this
theme deals with the political cultural aspects of political
recruitment, political socialization (learning what political
actors can and cannot do), and political projections of
individuals (personal appearance, public image, and the range of
acceptable campaign tactics). Political death refers to the
effective ending of political career possibilities. Hence this
theme is also concerned with the nature of political death,
factors causing political death (age, defeat, change of
residence, certain kinds of controversy), and the functional
utility of political death in the maintenance of political
systems or the introduction of political change.</p><p align="justify">
    The fourth theme, the Means to Perpetuate the Group and Its
Solidarity (including its norms), deals with the character of
political institutions, the institutional channels of political
communication, and the common modes of political socialization as
shaped by political cultural factors. Meeting Individual Demand
or an Orderly Way of Life is the fifth theme. It is concerned
with the nature of such demands (commonly held theories of
government and society) within particular political cultural
frameworks, the accepted "price of politics", and the accepted
ways of organizing to meet those demands.</p><p align="justify">
    The final theme, Meeting Individuals' Biological/Survival
Needs, involves the cultural definition of those needs, the ways
of organizing politically to meet those needs, and ultimately,
the definition of who is a person or citizen, which determines
who gets what in the way of protection of life and rights.</p><p align="justify">
    Every civil society expresses these cultural themes in its
own way and build its own synthesis of those expressions into a
cultural whole. The themes and the synthesis, like all cultural
phenomena, and dynamic, changing over time in response to
changing conditions, but always within a context that preserves
the continuity of the culture as a whole. While cultural change
is normal and even accelerated in the modern era, only occasional
social traumas of the most intense kind can later the fundamental
character of the culture itself. Tracing the cultural constants
in a world of change is one of the tasks of the study of
political culture.</p><p align="justify">
    In a slightly different vein, Edward Hall has suggested
studying culture through what he terms primary message systems,
separate but interrelated kinds of human activity stemming from
biological bases and reflecting the cultural accretions that form
the building blocks of specific cultures. Combined with the
cultural themes as adapted above, they enable us to penetrate
further into the study of political culture. Interaction, the
first of the ten primary message systems, is the central core of
the PMS approach because it is the basis of communication. For
our purposes, it leads us to recognize the kinds and patterns of
political communication as shaped by particular political
cultures. Association leads to the consideration of the forms of
political organization produced by particular cultures.
Subsistence opens up the topic of the relation of political
phenomena to economic life in particular political environments.
Similarly, Bisexuality opens up consideration of the relation of
political to family life in particular political cultures.
Territoriality suggests the need to deal with the location and
spread of political subcultures in space just as Temporality does
in time. Temporality also provides us with a way to examine
political cultural change. Learning leads us to study individual
socialization and cultural adaptation while Play leads to an
understanding of the nature and rules of the "game of politics."
Defense leads to the analysis of the ways and means of protecting
political cultural patterns devised in every group. Finally,
Exploitation (of materials) suggests consideration of political,
culturally directed thrusts and the limits imposed on political
management of the environment.</p><p align="justify">
    We can sum up this brief introduction to the study of
political culture by outlining the significant questions that
must be dealt with in a systematic analysis of the political
culture of any particular political system. The first is the
question of relation to authority (government and the political
system). It includes the identification of adaptive behavior in
interaction with authority, personal and group ideologies, and
central conception of the relationship of authority and self that
underlie, and are reflected in, behavior and ideology. In this
regard, it is important to distinguish between perceived
differentiations in kinds of authority and the differentiation in
responses to same. Related to a person's culturally determined
sense of relation to authority is the second question of
conception of self in relation to authority and to civil society
as a whole, both as a member of civil society (citizen) and as a
political actor.</p><p align="justify"> 
    The question of the culturally requisite social and
individual bases for maintaining inner equilibrium as a political
system is third. It is closely connected with the fourth question
regarding the major forms of political anxiety within a
particular cultural set, including perceived threats to the ego
structure and expected consequences of value violation. Both are
linked with the fifth one regarding the primary political
dilemmas or conflicts and ways of dealing with them. It may,
indeed, be possible that whole political systems are organized in
terms of one or a few primary dilemmas that are built into their
political cultures (for example, the tension between liberty and
equality in the United States) and play out their history through
a series of accommodations of those dilemmas.</p><p align="justify">
    The study of political culture is also concerned with four
more questions, namely those dealing with modes of cognitive
functioning, styles of expressive behavior, handling of major
dispositions (aggression, dependency, curiosity, and so forth),
and types of social (political) sanctions. Finally, there is the
question of the extent of political involvement sanctioned for
various individuals and groups within particular political
cultures. Here we must be concerned with both the degree and
direction of involvement.</p><p align="justify">
    A specific political culture may or may not coincide with a
particular political system or civil society, since patters of
orientation to politics frequently overlap beyond the boundaries
of specific political systems. At the same time, precisely
because culture is so central to human existence and politics so
important in shaping human society, every political system must
create some kind of cultural synthesis within its boundaries, at
least for those who actively participate in politics.
Historically, cultural conflict, in part because of its ties
to religion, has been among the most divisive experienced within
and between polities.</p><p align="justify">
    One aspect of the development of American civilization has
been the emergence of an American political culture created more
or less simultaneously on a sectional basis as well as
countrywide. The nation as a whole, every state, and most local
communities have created, synthesized or adapted their own
variations of this common political culture in response to the
phenomena including the interaction of geohistorical
location, demographic streams, and patterns of general culture,
plus the influence of the national political process.</p><p align="justify">
    The study of politics concerns itself with three
dimensions--political structure, political processes, and
political culture. Political structure relates to the
institutions of political life. Political processes deals with
political behavior and political culture deals with the norms of
politics and governance. As such, political culture is an
independent variable with a dynamic of its own.
    In this book, it is my intention to present a case for the
place of culture, and more particularly political culture, as one
of the three elements or benchmarks of human location. In my
previous work on the subject I have, for the most part,
concentrated, as have others, on political culture as a dynamic
variable in shaping political behavior.</p><p align="justify">
    At the same time, there is another dimension to culture in
general and political culture in particular which I refer to here
as the locational aspect. In causal conversation, we talk about
the people and their institutions being embedded in particular
cultures. This manner of speaking reflects a reality which
requires proper exploration by social scientists. Indeed, the
exploration of the phenomenon of location gives us the
possibility of placing our behavioral studies in a proper context
to avoid the problem of overgeneralization from "snapshot"
research. Proper consideration of location in all of its
dimensions, then, is necessary for a three dimensional political
science.</p><p align="justify">
    Each of the three dimensions has its own properties of
permanence or lack thereof. Spatial or geographic location taken
alone is fixed. By the same token, temporal or historic location
is constantly changing. Cultural location falls somewhere in
between; it appears fixed but actually changes in a gradual way.
Taken separately, each has its own dynamic but, taken together, a
different pattern emerges.</p><p align="justify">
    In fact, there is no such thing as location in one without
location in the others. Thus, location is fixed, geo-historical
location is not. The very passage of time brings with it
locational change that is geographic as well as historical. So,
for example, spatially the United States has been where it is
since the founding of the republic. But, whereas in the 19th
century that meant its geo-historical location was peripheral to
the great events of world affairs, one of isolation from the old
world, in the 20th century, that isolation disappeared as a
result of technological change, giving it a new geo-historical
location at the center of the world stage, by every new measure
close to the "action" on every continent. Or, to take a more
localized example, from the 1760s to the early 19th century
Pittsburgh was considered the gateway to the west, but as the
land frontier moved westward, it lost that geo-historical
locational characteristic and was instead enveloped by the
advancing urban-industrial frontier. By the time Abraham Lincoln
visited the city on his way east in February 1861 to be
inaugurated President, he felt it appropriate to use Pittsburgh
as a platform from which to address those who were part and
parcel of the new urban industrial age. A century later,
Pittsburgh was commonly referred to as being located in the
rustbelt, an economic backwater tied down by a decaying urban
industrial plant and an inability to compete in world markets.
Thus, its geo-historical location has regularly changed since its
founding.</p><p align="justify">
    In this connection, culture acts as a mediating force
responding to changes in geo-historical location or their
consequences in such a way that enables people confronted by
those changes to live with them, maintaining continuity yet
absorbing change.</p><p align="justify">
    Political culture plays a significant role in all of this. As
I have noted in my earlier research, political culture
similarities often provide useful assistance in bridging general
cultural gaps between groups (although) in some cases the reverse
is true: i.e., political cultural differences will exacerbate
cultural divisions). It is precisely because culture differs
from style in that the former reflects deeper orientations to
existence while the latter consists of more superficial
manifestations of accepted behavior that political culture serves
as a steadying force. </p><p align="justify">
    The distinction between political culture and political style
has been blurred in recent years. For example, the new political
orientations influencing American urban politics are often
mistakenly referred to as political cultures. They are, rather,
political styles or, perhaps, ideologies.</p><p align="justify">
    At the same time, expressions of political culture change as
geo-historical location shifts. For example, it has been
demonstrated that Minneapolis, Minnesota has purely a moralistic
political culture as one is likely to find. Between World War I
and the 1960s, this meant that the city was dominated by rather
straight-laced views with regard to what are defined in American
cultural politics as moral issues (e.g. gambling, prostitution,
obscenity and pornography, abortion). After the "revolution" of
the 1960s, most of that older political style fell by the
wayside. Once those "illicit" activities were redefined as
expressions of personal freedom, the cultural pacesetters in
Minneapolis embraced the notion that they should be protected
with moralistic fervor. Prostitution and displays previously
considered obscene or pornographic were particularly allowed to
flourish because they were now recognized as protected speech. It
was only after the massage parlors and escort services became
obvious breeding grounds form crime that there was again a shift
in attitude toward them. While these shifts in style were
apparent to the naked eye, what was not always apparent was the
degree to which they were absorbed within the same political
culture in each case, the overt changes were a result of a shift
in the temporal location of the city.</p><p align="justify">
    Consequently, one of the major difficulties in the study of
political culture is to distinguish between culture and style.
Here, too, it should be apparent that the factor of geo-historical
location can be of help in this regard. Shifts in location are
first likely to result in shifts in style which may or may not
ultimately induce cultural change.</p><p align="justify">
    In this book we will try to show how location in the three
dimensions of space, time and culture, is an important factor in
shaping American political life. We will emphasize geo-historical
location as the location of a civil society in time (history) and
space (geography) together. Location establishes the raw physical
and ecological conditions with which settlers must come to
terms; shapes the territorial limits of the society; orders the
flow of human migration; and influences the forms of political
institutions which are created to make use of the land. Each
location is shaped by the deposits of peoples and cultures who
settle it and by the varying ways they use the land over time.
Although we can speak of national geo-historical location, what
is notable about the United States is the rich diversity of
geo-historical locations resulting from the variety of
geographies, peoples, cultures and settlement periods within the
nation. One's particular location also shapes the way one looks at
the nation as a whole.</p><p align="justify"><BR>


                  <H3>The Rhythm of the Generations</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The rhythm of the generations is the central aspect of the
time element in geo-historical location. It is a way of
organizing the flow of history and of understanding the patterns
of political events in terms of the human life cycle. While in
many societies the beginnings of the generations have been lost
in the mists of time, in the United States it is possible to know
their foundings and to trace the subsequent generational cycles
from those points. Since the settlement in America there have
been twelve generations ranging in length from 26 to 43 years.
This is roughly the period during which most people experience
the productive phase of their life cycles. Each generation shares
a common heritage and set of experiences and challenges which
give it a distinct identity. At the beginning of a generation the
challenges of the times are introduced as political issues. The
issues are debated and when raised to the level of nationwide
concerns, the generation undertakes a period of response to the
issues followed by a period of consolidation which sets the stage
for the next generation.</p><p align="justify">
    The generation born after World War II, for example, is faced
with the task of maintaining a 200-year-old federal democracy in
a vastly new historical order marked by the rise of new nations
demanding a greater share of world resources, by new ideologies
demanding new national and international political arrangements,
and by the proliferation of nuclear weapons capable of rendering
human life extinct. These, in turn, have affected the
geo-historical location of the United States. The oceans are no
longer a defense barrier, but instead, act as cover for
submarines armed with nuclear weapons. World War II opened the
skies as perhaps the most lethal new battleground.</p><p align="justify">
    The richness of the American continent in terms of
agriculture, energy and minerals which allowed the United States
to become the world's most affluent civilization and to handle
many problems of justice by expanding the economic pie will take
on new importance for the next several generations. both domestic
and international politics will be affected by the degree to
which America's standard of living will require external sources
of natural resources like energy. New territorial disputes have
broken out over off-shore boundaries and the exploitation of
seabed resources. American agricultural abundance will, for
better or worse, play an important political role in a world
marked by widespread hunger. Finally, the need to preserve the
environment and conserve resources will pressure American
cultural habits and perhaps require new political policies
capable of dealing effectively with issues of social justice and
international peace in a time of rising expectations and
uncertain solutions.</p><p align="justify">
    In the following chapters we will focus on the spatial,
temporal and cultural aspects of location to see how they help
shape American political behavior.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify"><BR>


                      <H3>Location and Change</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Every civil society has its own particular location in space
and time. That location can be seen as resting on earlier
locational "strata" which continues to influence contemporary
life. In that sense, every polity may be said to rest upon its
own "geological" base. The geology of each polity plays a
fundamental role in dictating the context in which its political
and social systems must operate, the broad limits of its
discretion, the structuring of its political concerns, and the
continuing character of the political interaction within it. In
this chapter we will review some familiar history of American
settlement but from a new perspective -- looking at old materials
with new eyes.</p><p align="justify">
    While the cumulative effects of location in space and time
are limiting in may ways, the very passage of time in a
civilization oriented to change, such as that of the United
States, also represents the opening of new opportunities. In one
sense, at least, this is a new phenomenon. The opening of the
modern age in the 17th century, which coincided with the
settlement of English-speaking North America and the foundation
of American civilization, not only initiated an epoch of change,
but initiated a chain reaction that has accelerated the process of
change. The result has been the virtual institutionalization of
change in all modern societies, and most particularly in the
United States. As change became institutionalized, the time lost
its static character which, in premodern times, made its passage
well-nigh imperceptible from generation to generation. Now it has
become an almost visible force, opening new frontiers for human
development in every generation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Brought down to concrete terms, the dynamics of geohistorical
location (that is, location in space and time) change the
effective positioning of every civil society, virtually every
generation. No polity or community ever really "stands still."
Changes in location make it necessary for American local
communities to perpetually reconstitute themselves politically
much as they must reconstruct themselves economically and
physically. In that sense, the American novelist, Thomas Wolfe,
was right when he wrote" "You can't go home again." Indeed, such
changes can transform previously prosperous communities into
depressed ones through no apparent fault of their own, especially
in the case of communities that rely heavily on one type of
economic activity which becomes outmoded by time.</p><p align="justify">
    The ghost town is a familiar feature in American history. A
ghost town is one which lives off of a particular economic
function for a few years or even a generation and then is emptied
with it becomes obsolete because of economic or technological
changes. In terms of its geographic position, it remains in the
same place; but its temporal location shifts with disastrous
consequence. It did not "keep up with the times."  Hence "the
times passed it by" and its inhabitants moved elsewhere, either
for greater opportunity or simply in order to survive.  We think
of ghost towns as primarily associated with the mining industry,
some of which became ghost towns because the mines played out.
But the change in the price of gold, copper, or iron or the
discovery of deposits more easily or cheaply mined elsewhere
often played the same role.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The other primary examples of ghost towns in the United
States are the agricultural towns and villages that grew up in
the nineteenth century to serve the surrounding farms and which
were made outmoded by changing transportation and merchandising
technologies in the twentieth century.  Once the automobile came
along it was no longer necessary for there to be a town within an
easy walk or horseback ride of every farm.  People could travel
further in the same amount of time to secure supplies, while
rising levels of prosperity and merchandising meant that there
had to be larger concentrations of people to provide the new
levels of consumer goods and services sought.  Times changed and
whole communities died out, becoming ghost towns in their own
right.</p><p align="justify">
    The big cities of the United States are presently undergoing
similarly drastic transformations, also as a result of changing
times.  Densely populated cities developed when there was a need
for larger concentrations of workers to man industrial and
commercial enterprises, while transportation technology required
that those workers live relatively close to work sites, or at
least to the railroad and streetcar lines that took them to work.
Masses of new immigrants to the cities, just starting out, were
willing to put up with conditions of population density and
limited space or had no alternative but do do so. As people
prospered and the automobile made it possible to travel longer
distances to work, big cities lost population to the suburbs.
Then cybernetic technology made even the necessity of gathering
together less important in a growing number of fields.  Each of
these changes effectively changed the geohistorical location of
the big cities as similar changes had transformed the position of
mining and agricultural towns.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Conversely, temporal changes of this nature also make it
possible for backwater communities to transcend the limitations
of past location by capitalizing on new potentialities.  The
mining towns of Colorado, for example, were on the cutting edge
of the frontier in the late nineteenth century.  Then the mines
played out or became uneconomic.  If they survived at all, they
survived as backwaters for the first half of the twentieth
century.  After World War II, the new leisure-time activities of
skiing and mountain recreation, coupled with the new developments
in telecommunications, put them again on the cutting edge of
American development, at least sufficiently to become vibrant if
still small communities once again.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The "historical geology" of social phenomena is such that
there is some "beginning" or founding in every social order at
the point where space and time are first linked in the life of a
particular social system. The bedrock upon which the subsequent
strata of human activity are deposited is located at the point
where particular people first begin to function in systematic
relationship to one another on a particular territory. The
continued effects of that first linkage and their modification by
the deposits of later human activity, the upheaval of subsequent
events, and the simple erosion of time provide the framework
within which social systems develop and, as such, constitute basic
matter for social investigation.</p><p align="justify">
    Alexis De Tocqueville accurately described the importance of
foundings in civil society and how studying the history of the
United States of America offers us the opportunity to learn the
whole story of a particular country and people:

    to be called the national character. We should there be able
    to discover the explanation of customs which no seem contrary

    here and there in society that hand like the broken chains

    The United States provides one the very best settings
available for the study of social and political systems from the
geo-historical point of view because of its character as a
"new-society." It is one of the few countries in which the
interaction between space-time, political systems, and political
processes can be traced "from the beginning" with reasonable
accuracy and within a manageable time span. We possess detailed
information about the development of this country from the days
of the first settlers, and the entire process has taken place
within a span of less than four centuries (or less than twelve
generations). Scholars and scientists who study social phenomena
in the United States are thus given an unparalleled opportunity
to develop a multi-dimensional analysis of a society from its
first foundations with a thoroughness that can be duplicated in
few other parts of the world.

    Look at a map of North America  and think a moment
of how Americans perceive their land. Most Americans look at the
land from east to west, a habit instilled by studying the history
of settlement of their country which was essentially a movement
from east to west. Americans who live on the west coast, however,
look at the land from west to east, which significantly enough, 
parallels the way in which the western third of the country was
settled after the initial arrival of the settlers from the east
coast. Alaskans, a small but hardy breed, look southward to "the
lower 48," just as Hawaiians look to "the mainland."

    In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville already saw the United States
(which at that time did no extend west of the Rocky Mountains or
southwest of the Arkansas River) as an integrated whole. As a
Frenchman looking at a map he did not begin with the cultural
preconceptions that Americans bring with them. He could see North
America falling into two roughly equal natural divisions, one
encompassing the territories from which the waters flowed
northward, i.e., the Hudson's Bay - Arctic Ocean - St.  Lawrence
River basins which became the nucleus of Canada and the other
encompassing the southward, principally the Mississippi -
Missouri - Ohio Rivers basin with the respective coasts attached
to each. Based on this understanding, he predicted fifteen years
in advance that the Americans would acquire the Pacific coast
from Puget Sound to the Gulf of California, and what were then
the northernmost territories of Mexico, now Texas and the
American southwest. He believed that because those relatively
empty lands which were part of a natural geographic extension of
the Mississippi Valley, they could not long remain in the
possession of another nation.</p><p align="justify">
    De Tocqueville was right. The force of American expansion
absorbed those vast territories before the mid-century mark
through purchase, annexation and the Mexican War. The country's
response to the Mexican war itself was determined to a large
extent by geography. New Englanders, who were most detached from
the geographic situation, generally took a moral stand in
opposition to the war as unnecessary and unjust. The settlers of
the Mississippi Valley, north and south, with a few notable
exceptions (including Abraham Lincoln), saw the war as
absolutely necessary to secure their flanks. They saw the
absorption of the new land as the most natural thin in the
world.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT> Standing in St. Louis, at approximately the point where
the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio Rivers meet, one is likely to

    What was (and is) it about the land that had the most potent
consequences for its settlement and political organization? First
of all, there was its vastness. For Europeans, especially people
from the British Isles, the sheer size of the continent was
impressive. In 1783, when the United States and Britain signed
the peace treaty ending the Revolutionary War, the territory that
came under the American flag (888,655 square miles) was already
larger than the twelve member European community established two
hundred years later -- the British Isles plus all of Spain,
Portugal, France, Germany, the Low Countries, Denmark, Italy and
Greece put together. by 1819, after the Louisiana Purchase and
the acquisition of Florida, the still infant republic was larger
than all of Europe excepting European Russia and Romania. Today
the United States is approximately the same size as all of Europe
-- from the Atlantic to the Urals, as the expression goes.</p><p align="justify">
    Wyoming is larger than all of Great Britain; Texas is larger
than France; California is larger than both Germanies combined;
Indiana is larger than Austria, and smallish West Virginia is
considerably larger than Switzerland. The United States now
extends over eight time zones. When it is 1 PM in Puerto Rico or
the Virgin Island, it is 6 AM in western Alaska. Only Russia has
a larger expanse.</p><p align="justify">
    The land that was to become the United States was not only
vast but open, that is, accessible from without and within.
Indeed, it may be more than coincidence that the United States,
which is the preeminently "open society," benefited first from
geographic openness. Its Atlantic coast has many good deep-water
and ice-free harbors and the coastal area is penetrated by many
navigable rivers. The central part of the country is drained by
the world's mightiest river system, that of the Mississippi and
its tributaries, most of which were navigable in the 19th century
when settlers first entered the basin in large numbers. While the
country is divided by three major mountain systems, the
Appalachians, the Rockies, and the Sierra Nevadas, all three are
broken by broad passes as crucial points. Ease of movement, then,
has been a hallmark of American geography.</p><p align="justify">
    A third geographic element in the shaping of American society
is the country's diversity. Because of its geographic situation,
the United States embraces every kind of climate from Arctic cold
to sub-tropical and even tropical heat; from rain forests to the
most rain free deserts, with almost every conceivable variety of
land form and vegetation. This aspect contributed to the
availability of and abundance of the many diverse resources
needed to create a large, modern civilization and also provided a
geographic undergirding to the human diversity which continues to
characterize American society.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The shape of the land substantially influenced the way the
settlers occupied it. Until 1759, North America was divided among
four great powers: France, Britain, Spain and Russia. Geography
shaped the role of each. The French had entered the continent
through the broad St. Lawrence Gulf founding Quebec in 1608.
Using the Great Lakes, they rapidly penetrated into the interior
to link up with the Mississippi River system and acquire the
entire Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf of Mexico during the
17th century. While the French established outposts wherever they
raised their flag, the main attraction of the land to them was
its capacity to produce furs. Consequently, their wide
penetration, which in the 18th century sent them as far west as
the Great Plains, did not lay the foundation for permanent
settlement even though it gave them the major share of the
continent. Thus, when the British were able to capture Quebec
and Montreal, the two key centers of French Canada, the entire
French empire in North America collapsed.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The Spanish, who had established their empire in the central
and southern parts of the western hemisphere in the early 16th
century, turned northward from central Mexico and established
their presence in what is now the American southwest by the end
of that century. They consolidated their presence in the 17th,
but did little more than establish outposts at the farthest end
of the empire. In one last burst of energy, at the time of the
American Revolution, they also settled California, partly in an
effort to forestall the expected British and Russian moves in the
same direction. Barely more than a generation later, they were to
be displaced by the revolt of the indigenous inhabitants of
greater Mexico.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Russian North America, today the State of Alaska, represented
the culmination of another great pioneering sweep of modern
times, the eastward movement of the Russians across Siberia in
the 16th and 17th centuries. After acquiring the vast Siberian
lands for the Czar, the intrepid Russian explorers and pioneers
crossed the Bering Strait and planted settlements on the North
American continent which they would hold until 1867.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The farthest Russian penetration into North America was Fort
Ross, approximately 90 miles north of San Francisco, on the
Pacific coast (today Fort Ross State Park). It represented the
culmination of four thousand years of western movement. In the
1820s, Fort Ross was the southern-most Russian outpost in North
America. For a brief moment, it reflected the expansionist
ambitions of certain Russian leaders, who saw in the still
politically chaotic Pacific coast of North America of the early
nineteenth century a chance to extend Russian hegemony southward
in the face of rival British, American and Spanish claims. The
Russian effort was brief and unsuccessful. It had no real support
from Moscow and was confronted by intense opposition from the
rival claimants. The Russians abandoned the fort in the 1830s
withdrawing to Alaska where they were to sit for another thirty
years until Secretary of State William Seward arranged to
purchase that territory for the United States. Today, Fort Ross
is a collection of restored log structures whose piquant history
attracts visitors to a lovely section of the California coast.</p><p align="justify">
    In one sense, however, Fort Ross is far more significant
than its brief history would indicate. In effect, it was at that
point that the convergence of various elements of what we
generally define as Western civilization brought to a culmination
four millennia or more of expansion that ultimately embraced the
whole globe.</p><p align="justify">
    Five thousand years before the founding of Fort Ross, the
West Asian civilizations out of which western civilization was to
spring, were reaching their height in the fertile crescent from
the Nile to the Tigres and Euphrates valleys. A millennium and a
half later, Israel emerged on the scene at the very western end
of that region to give birth to Judaism which became the
religious foundation of western civilization. Shortly thereafter,
the Greeks, much influenced by the great civilizations of ancient
West Asia, began the development of what was to become western
philosophy and science, first in Asia Minor and then in
southeastern Europe.  Between the Semitic peoples of the
Mediterranean coast and the Hellenic peoples of the Greek isles,
what became western civilization was spread throughout the
Mediterranean Basin during the course of the millennium
immediately prior to the rise of Christianity. </p><p align="justify">
    Two thousand years ago, Christianity was born out of the
Jewish people and within its first millennium synthesized its
understanding of Jewish religious thought with the contributions
of Greek civilization and spread throughout Europe. The energies
of the West thus organized and released, the following millennium
saw the Christianized Russians move eastward and the
Christianized Spanish, French and British peoples move westward
away from their European heartlands to colonize vast new
territories and implant western civilization within them. The
eastward movement of the Russians and the westward movement of
the other European nations finally met after having girdled the
globe in northern California at Fort Ross, thereby completing
literally millennia of migration, settlement and cultural
transformation whose consequences became quite apparent in the
twentieth century as the entire globe acquired at least the
external elements of western civilization.</p><p align="justify">
    Finally, there was British North America, territorially the
smallest segment of the continent before 1759, but the most
thoroughly settled and the most fully organized politically.
Here, geography and politics intersect. For France, Spain and
Russia, their North American possessions were outposts of empire,
far removed from the centers of power in the mother country and
not even of great interest to the centers of settlement in the
colonial areas which had served as springboards for their
advance. This was not so in the case of the settler who came to
British North America. For them, the new continent became a vast
frontier of expansion. The Atlantic coastal colonies were a
natural extension of the British Isles. Moreover, instead of
being settled as commercial or strategic outposts of a mother
country, they were settled by people who came to stay and make
their homes. For them, America was the center of the world, not
London. Moreover, they were organized politically into what were,
in effect, self governing dominions, linked with the mother
country in a kind of imperial federation, not as in the case of
the other possessions, mere colonies, politically dependent upon
the motherland in every respect.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    This combination of geography and politics proved
irresistible. The British, significantly assisted by the British
North Americans, brought about a culmination of two generations
of struggle between Britain and France by eliminating the French
as a significant presence in North America. While the Americans
then proceeded to eliminate the British, they did so on a basis
that so consolidated their own position that in the course of the
next century, as they expanded westward, they proceeded to
eliminate the French, Spanish and Russians in turn, leaving North
America north of the Rio Grande essentially an English-speaking
preserve. In this effort we see one important facet of
politics -- the ability of people to use politics to concentrate
their will and impose it upon vast territories and great people.</p><p align="justify">
    A century after the elimination of the French, the gross
political boundaries of North America were essentially fixed.
Even the boundaries of the sub-units of much of the continent
were established with political configurations already outpacing
the spread of settlement in certain areas. On the eve of the
Civil War, sectionalism, the expression of social and political
differences along geographic lines was a powerful political
force.</p><p align="justify">
    The three original sections, New England, the Middle States
and the South, had expanded westward as a result of the migration
of their sons and daughters. The heirs of the Puritans had
established a greater New England in upper New York State,
northern Pennsylvania, the northern third of Ohio, Michigan, the
northern corners of Indiana, northern and northwestern Illinois,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, the northern two thirds of Iowa,
northeastern Kansas, and Western Oregon with outposts in western
Washington, and southern California.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT> The sons and daughters of
the Middle States had occupied central Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois, southern Iowa, northern Missouri, southwestern
Wisconsin, eastern Nebraska, and the settled parts of central
California.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT> While these two streams were often separated in
their patterns of local settlement, in most cases they found
themselves within the same states, a phenomenon that was repeated
on the east coast as New Englanders began to settle in New York
City in great numbers, attracted by the commercial possibilities
of that metropolis. Thus, over time, they had grown together to
become the North despite the internal differences that still
divided them. As the North, they had established a west of their
own including the old northwest (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan and Wisconsin) and the still barely settled
trans-Mississippi west.</p><p align="justify">
    Meanwhile, the Southerners pushing due westward had
established two wests of their own -- the old southwest
(Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi) and the
trans-Mississippi southwest. Both were tied tightly to the sold
South through slavery, "the peculiar institution" which created a
cohesiveness in the South, unequalled north of the Mason-Dixon
line or the Ohio River.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT> </p><p align="justify">
    Settlement from both the north and the south had leaped over
the central sections of the trans-Mississippi west, still known
then as "the great American desert," to establish chains of
settlements on the Pacific coast. The great area in the middle,
barely penetrated by permanent settlers in 1861 (except for the
Mormons in Utah) and a few gold-seekers in Colorado, was to be
settled essentially after the Civil War by a mixture of
northerners and southerners quite different from that common to
the pre-Civil War efforts.</p><p align="justify">
    Over a hundred years later, the end product of the first
thrust of American settlement is still very visible.  The South most clearly retains its identity as a separate
section while, as we shall see, the North has three components --
the old northeast; the north's original west, that is to say
those states settled after the adoption of the Constitution but
before the Civil War, and the post-Civil War west. In the
intervening century, the change in pattern of settlement was not
simply the filling in of the vacant areas of 1861, but the
transformation of the American population into an urban and then
a metropolitan one, with all the essential political boundaries
drawn and apparently fixed. Over 25 years have passed since then.
While the nationwide pattern is generally the same, Americans
have continued to move, in many cases along tried and true lines.
At the same time, it was during these years that the migration to
the Sunbelt became a flood, with so many northeasterners and
midwesterners moving to Florida, the Gulf Coast, Texas, the
southwestern desert states, California, and the Pacific
Northwest.  While slowed by the economic downturn in the
oil-producing states in the early 1980s, the flow from Frostbelt
to Sunbelt has continued overall.</p><p align="justify">
    At the same time, the centrifugal movement away from central
cities continued into the countryside to create belts of rurban
development, where very urbanized people settle in small towns or
in the rural areas around them.  A series of National Geographic
maps prepared for the bicentennial of American independence
graphically describe the results.</p><BR><p align="justify">


                   <H3> State and Local Parallels</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Each state and locality has gone through a similar process of
development conditioned by its own particular geographic
characteristics. Take for example, the State of Illinois, located
at the geo-historical crossroads of the United States, where
North and South, East and West, and all the migratory streams
meet. It first appears in the pages of Western history, in the
mid-17th century as what the French called the Illinois country
after the Indian tribe of that name which inhabited the land
between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River along the banks
of the Illinois River.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    A land which sits astride the heart of the country's
principal river system, where the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio
rivers meet, the outlines of its future borders can be seen in
the rivers themselves (although only in retrospect, since the use
of any particular set of "natural" boundaries is a matter of
human choice). The rivers represent one of the two distinguishing
features of the flat-to-gently rolling Illinois country. The
other is the line separating the wooded areas of the southern and
eastern United States from the prairies that mark the beginning
of the greater West.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Looking at a map, the keen observer notes
immediately how open Illinois is -- the very acme of openness in
a country noted for openness. Rivers penetrate its every segment.
To the northeast, the portage between the Great Lakes - St.
Lawrence River system and the Mississippi River system is short
and over a range of barely perceptible hills. It is no wonder
that it became one of the main avenues of French exploration of
the North American interior or that a century later it would
become the jumping off point for the great western expedition,
beginning with that of Lewis and Clark (1803-06). Yet in the
hundred years between the time the French began their
explorations and the state's conquest by Virginians during the
Revolution, little had been done to settle the open Illinois
country nor had any boundaries been fixed to give it meaning
other than as a geographic term.</p><p align="justify">
    The Americans who came to settle and organize the land were
the first to impose boundaries upon it. Illinois became part of
the Indian Territory. In 1809 it became a territory in its own
right, take the French corruption of the name of the principal
Indian nation that had been located within its new borders.
Finally in 1818, Illinois became a state. In each case, the
change in political status was accompanied by a redefinition of
boundaries. With statehood came the most successful negotiation
of Illinois' history. The territory's representative in Congress
was able to secure a northern boundary for the new state that
gave it an outlet on Lake Michigan, essentially the area that is
today metropolitan Chicago. this entitled it to fulfill its vital
role as a bridge between east and west, north and south.</p><p align="justify">
    By 1818, the immigration to Illinois was in full tide.
Politically, because of the Ohio River, Illinois is a northern
state (which in its earlier days meant that slavery was
prohibited within its boundaries by Congress regardless of local
preference). Geographically, however, southern Illinois is due
west of Virginia, hence the first waves of migration came into
the new state's southern reaches and were mostly southerners.
    The rest of the state was settled between 1818 and 1861.
Until the mid-1820s, southerners were the most prominent
immigrants to Illinois. Then for a decade people from the middle
states were dominant. After 1835, the opening of lands in
northern Illinois (a result of the Black Hawk War) led to an
influx of New Englanders. Thus in no more than 50 years all three
major native population segments of the United States had
entrenched themselves in the state, making its internal political
life quite as complex as that of the United States as a whole,
but within a much smaller territory.</p><p align="justify">
    The political life within those boundaries had to reflect the
various differences. The history of the establishment of its 102
countries encapsulizes its internal political development. New
counties were erected to give new migrants a chance to control
their own local affairs. Within those counties where New
Englanders settled, townships were established (though the state
constitution had to be changed to allow it, in a compromise
struck between the Yankees and the southerners in 1848).
Otherwise the counties were governed as units without the benefit
of such sub-division.</p><p align="justify">
    One hundred and twenty years later, Illinois exhibits the
impact of urbanization and metropolitanization within an already
completely settled and politically organized civil society. The
pattern of the Chicago metropolitan area shows this in greater
detail, particularly in the way that territorial divisions can be
used to achieve political goals, in this case the goals of local
self-government on a scale deemed appropriate by the
decision-makers involved.</p><p align="justify">
    The smallest communities and the most comprehensive civil
societies are alike in that they are shaped by their
geohistorical location. No understanding of American politics in
any arena -- national, state, or local -- is possible without
taking that into consideration. In the following chapters we will
have occasion to explore the full meaning of this in detail.</p><BR><p align="justify">





                             <CENTER><H3>Summary
</H3></CENTER></p><p align="justify">
Location, understood as location in space, in time and in
culture, is the critical concept to be explored in this book.  It
is argued that the beginning of understanding of a polity and its
political system is understanding its three-dimensional location.
Particular attention is paid to cultural location and its
relationship to society and the individual personality. Special
attention is paid to the relationship between culture and
religion, and ethnicity.
</p><p align="justify">
The changing pattern of this tri-dimensional location is to be
found in the rhythm of the generations, a theme also introduced
in this chapter.  A theory of the generational rhythm is
presented and outlined.  With this in place we turn to look at
the relationship between location and change, in general, and
more specifically in the United States where the combined
influence of the continuing American frontier and American
sectionalism play a special role in shaping the changing location
of the United States.
</p><p align="justify">
The chapter concludes with an outline of these patterns at work
in the United States and in the State of Illinois, a good example
of a state located at the cultural and geohistorical crossroads
of the country.
