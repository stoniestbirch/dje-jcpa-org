      The theory of the continuing frontier is what is known as a
dynamic theory, that is to say, it is one that not only takes
account of movement and change but which is based on movement and
change as permanent realities.  It is a theory that emphasizes
action and interaction.  In American history one of the major
interactions was between frontiers and foundings.  As
Tocqueville noted, the manner of founding contributes much to
shaping the patterns of later development.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>  </p><p align="justify">

    Part of the process of founding is the determination of the
generational rhythm of the particular civil society, the way in
which it is likely to respond to challenges, and the basic
tensions around which it is constructed; that is to say, those
great questions which must be reconciled in the process of
founding but whose reconciliation is never entirely complete.
Thus, great questions which reinforce each other and remain in
tension with one another, need to be reconciled anew in each
generation.  </p><p align="justify">
    For example, American civil society was founded on the dual
bases of liberty and equality. On one hand, the two go hand in
hand, reinforcing each other, each making the other possible.  On
the other hand, at a certain point they also stand in tension
with one another, when the liberty for everyone to make of
himself what he wishes flies in the face of equality, while the
press for equality may limit individual liberty.  The tension
between the two has been reconciled anew in every generation of
American history.  If frontiers bring new challenges to a civil
society, its foundings strongly influence the character of the
responses.</p><p align="justify">
    In this chapter we will review the founding of the United
States from the first new settlement at Jamestown in 1607 through
the War of 1812, often known as the second war of independence,
which completed the separation of the United States from its
European challengers and completed the founding work of the
revolutionary and constitutional periods.  We will do so by
applying the generational model presented in Chapter Three.</p><BR>


         <H3><CENTER>    The Seventeenth Century (1607-1713)</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The five generations before 1789 were responsible for the
founding of the thirteen original colonies and five other
states-to-be, the creation of civil societies in all of them, the
establishment of an American civilization, the forging of a
national identity, and the winning of American independence.
During the first three generations, the English established their
presence in North America and began the process of becoming
Americans. At first, the colonies proceeded to develop more or
less separately. The fact that their development followed along
the same generational patterns, even to the point of adjusting to
a common time-span, reflects the universal character of the
generational flow. By the beginning of the third generation, a
common generational pattern of events was beginning to emerge,
though still with substantial local variations. The transfer to
the generational pattern from England to America and the movement
from locally discreet to increasingly continental patterns are
the subjects of this chapter.</p><BR>


                <H3><CENTER>The First Generation (1607-1648)</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The first generation of American history was marked by the
founding of Virginia, New York and Massachusetts, the three
"mother" colonies of the original three sections of the United
States, the colonies that created the country's three basic
cultural patterns. Though Virginia, founded considerably before
the others in 1607, reached its years of political response at a
time when the other colonies were still in the first stages of
founding, by the end of the generation, the alignment of events
was becoming clear for all three.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">


<H3>    A. Principal Political Patterns and Events:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Virginia's pattern was indeed the most orthodox since the
bulk of its founders were young men at the beginning of their
mature years.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT> From 1607 through 1609, they underwent the trials
of the founding then settled into a nine-year period of
generational buildup in the area between the James and York
rivers in which they became entrenched in the land and developed
demands for self-government and economic growth. These demands
were met during the years of political response from 1619 through
1624 beginning with the establishment of representative
institutions and culminating in Virginia's becoming a colony.
For the next twenty years, the colony consolidated itself and
developed its institutions then in the years immediately
following the Indian war of 1644, completed its generational
cycle and turned toward the interior.</p><p align="justify">
    New York, or New Netherlands, followed a pattern nearly as
straight forward.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT> Beginning with a fort and trading post in
1613, the colony developed in a desultory fashion during eleven
years of generational buildup. It took a giant step forward in
1624 with the purchase of Manhattan Island, the appointment of
the first resident governor of stature and the intensification of
colonization activities. The period of political response came to
an end in 1629 with the introduction of the patroon system as the
means of fostering permanent rural settlement. The colony then
entered an eighteen year period of settlement and consolidation
along the Hudson River from Staten Island to Albany which
culminated in the appointment of Peter Stuyvesant as governor in
1647 and the introduction of an expansionist policy.</p><p align="justify">
    Massachusetts had something of a dual founding.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT> The Plymouth
colony established in 1620 followed the usual pattern of
settlement but its influence was limited and it remained for the
Massachusetts Bay colony of 1629 to found New England. The latter
colony was founded at mid-generation by men in mid-career. It was
itself a decisive political response to the struggles of the
Puritans in England and consequently does not follow the orthodox
generational pattern. Its leaders had generally been leaders of
the Puritan movement in the old country who had come to despair
of real success there and decided to build a new "city upon a
hill" in the New World.</p><p align="justify">
    Because the colony itself was a decisive political response,
it embarked immediately on a series of activities appropriate to
that period with the generational cycle, establishing
institutions and even daughter colonies (Connecticut, Rhode
Island, and New Hampshire) that reflected different versions of
the new society the Puritans hoped to build. The decade from the
founding in 1692 to the adoption of the Fundamental Orders of
Connecticut in 1639 was one of decisive political response.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT> It
was followed by nine years of stabilization and consolidation,
culminating in the New England colonies' response to the English
Civil War, which led to a number of constitutional actions to
ratify and institutionalize the gains of the Puritans' first
generation in the new work and also brought their pattern into
harmony with the overall generational movement.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    B. Government and the Economy:<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></H3></p><p align="justify">

    The relationship between government and the economy was
essentially the same in all three colonies. The notion of
separation between the governing authorities and the economy in
the contemporary sense did not exist. All three colonies were
established under the aegis of trading companies that were
government monopolies and which, in turn, were responsible for
governing the settlers. At first, it was assumed that the
colonists would not even pursue individual goals but would work
collectively for their respective companies. This approach failed
in all three cases during the founding period and was replaced
during the generational buildup by progressively greater
individualization of economic effort, though still under the
relatively rigid control of the authorities. Moreover, a
significant aspect of the years of political response was the
struggle between the colonists and the mother company for the
right of self-government. This right was substantially won in
Virginia and Massachusetts during the first generation (Rhode
Island and Connecticut, as offshoots of Massachusetts not
beholden to a trading company, simply claimed it as their own).
New York did not win that right until the British conquest a
generation later.</p><p align="justify">
    When the governing powers were transferred to the colonists,
the power of control over the economy was divided so that
domestic economy was controlled locally while the imperial
authorities assumed control over foreign and intra-imperial
trade.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

   <H3> C. Principal Ethno-Religious Manifestations:<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></H3></p><p align="justify">

    Ethno-religious homogeneity was the goal of all three colonial
establishments in the first generation and in all three it was
maintained with great difficulty from the beginning. All three
had established churches and had to combat dissenters. Virginia
and Anglican, New York was Dutch Reformed and Massachusetts was
Puritan (what later came to be known as Congregational).
Nonconformers were expelled from the colonies whenever possible.
At the very least, they were forced or encouraged to go out into
the wilderness to establish their own settlements in which
theirs would be the reigning orthodoxy. This was territorial
democracy of the old kind in which territories stood for
something but anyone could go out and create his own territorial
community. Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire
were all founded a cases in point.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT>
    In this first generation the settlers in the various colonies
were either of English or Dutch stock. Only scattered individuals
from other ethnic or national groups could be found and they
generally assimilated or left. The introduction of blacks was the
beginning of significant ethno-racial pluralism in North
America.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT> The Indians were not only looked upon as separate
nations but as potentially powerful antagonists since, throughout
the first generations their numbers were no less than equal to
those of the settlers, if not greater.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></p><BR>

    
             <H3><CENTER>   The Second Generation (1648-1676)</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    Just as the events of the first generation revolved around
foundings and were concluded by constitutional actions designed
to institutionalize the progress made, the second generation was
concerned with nativizing the colonies and transferring control
over their domestic institutions from the Old World to the New.
The impetus to do this stemmed in part from the simple fact that
a native-born generation began to reach maturity, in part because
the English Civil War eliminated or reduced the mother country's
role in colonial affairs for the first half of the generation,
and in part because the restoration of the throne in England was
followed by the consolidation of English authority along the
Atlantic coast between Canada and Florida.
</p><p align="justify">


<H3>    A. Major Political Patterns and Events:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Given the equivocal position of Maryland, as a border colony
exposed to Puritan and Cavalier influences even in the
seventeenth century, the South continued to be essentially
Virginia.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT> Virginians began to filter into what was to become
North Carolina in the 1650s, at the beginning of the generation
and they were there in sufficient numbers to mount a rebellion
against the Navigation Acts (Culpepper's Rebellion) that coincided
with Bacon's Rebellion to close it, but it was not until the next
generation that North Carolina required identity as an entity in
its own right.</p><p align="justify">
    Virginia, itself, became virtually independent in the wake of
the Civil War. Its leadership, consisting primarily of
freeholders and merchants, refused to acknowledge the authority
of the Commonwealth and the colony became a dominion, managing
its own affairs until the Restoration in mid-generation (1660).
Overall, the generation was dominated by the relations between
autocratic Governor Berkeley, whose two terms (1641-52, 1660-77)
virtually encompassed it, and the new native generation of
Virginians who ultimately secured his removal in their struggle
for self-rule.</p><p align="justify">
    The major political responses of the generation in Virginia
revolved around the restoration of English authority through
Berkeley and the Navigation Acts (which crippled the local
economy) and the institutionalization of slavery which was made
the permanent and irrevocable conditions of all blacks in the
dominion in a series of acts during the 1660s. The culmination
of the generation came in Bacon's Rebellion, the first major
American challenge of British authority. Provoked by the impact
of the Navigation Acts, Berkeley's autocratic rule, and Indian
wars encouraged by the governor to prevent the expansion of the
settlement, it marked a fitting completion to the task of the
generation, namely the defining of separate American (or, more
properly, Virginian) interests in contra-distinction to English
ones.</p><p align="justify">
    New Netherlands - New York continued to be the sum of the
Middle States in the second generation just as Virginia continued
to be the sum of the South. In fact the first part of the
generation (which effectively commenced when Peter Stuyvesant
became governor and infused new energy into the colony) was
devoted to Dutch efforts to use New Netherlands as a base to
literally conquer the entire region. Between 1647 and 1655, the
Dutch established their hegemony from Delaware to upper New York
State, even threatening southern New England. As a result, the
entire generation was taken up with the struggle between the
Dutch and the English for regional control (1647-1774). In 1664,
the tide turned against the Dutch who lost New Amsterdam and the
Hudson Valley as well as the peripheral areas of their domain. The
first was briefly reconquered in 1773, permanently ending the
Dutch threat to conclude a generation of conflict.</p><p align="justify">
    Internally, the period of generational buildup saw New
Amsterdam acquire municipal status and introduce the first
rudimentary municipal services while the period of political
response revolved around the English conquest and confirmation of
the established constitutional arrangements, the major change
brought by the English was to legitimize the ethnic and religious
pluralism of the colony and particularly New York City which had
already begun to develop under the reluctant Dutch. New York
became a colony devoted to business and open to virtually all who
were interested in pursuing the goals of commerce. Fittingly
enough, the generation closed with the chartering of the first
entirely American business corporation in 1675.</p><p align="justify">
    The peripheral regions of Stuyvesant's greater New Netherlands
were given their own identity by the English in a second
generation. New Jersey, a kind of no-mans-land for the first half
of the generation, was anglicized between 1663 and 1666.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT>
Representative government was introduced in 1668 then, to
conclude the generation, the territory was divided into East and
West Jersey in 1676. Delaware, conquered in 1664, remained in
political limbo until 1673 when the English legal system was
introduced there and life was normalized as an English colony.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    New England was the only region that had spawned several
colonies during the founding generation. Of the six states of
contemporary New England, only Vermont was without any settlement
in 1640. Ideological differences within the overall framework of
Puritan theology and the use of the federal principles that
formed the organizational basis of all Puritan settlements both
functioned to encourage a proliferation of towns and the
federation of like-minded town into colonies. In fact, by the end
of the first generation, several of the independent towns and
colonies had begun to experiment with regional or intercolonial
confederation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The period of intra-colonial constitutional activity that
marked the closing of the first generation also marked the
opening of the second. It was followed by a period of
generational buildup that saw the introduction of further federal
experiments on the regional plane leading to the United Colonies
of New England which functioned on and off during the generation
plus further efforts to shape the internal structure of the
individual colonies themselves. Massachusetts clarified its
hegemony over New Hampshire (which would not become an
independent colony until the next generation) and annexed Maine
in 1652, (the latter act was legalized in 1677 at the very end of
the generation when the colony formally bought the rights of the
heirs of Sir Ferdinand Gorges, the founder of Maine's
settlement).<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT> This process continued during the years of
political response when Connecticut obtained a royal charter
affirming its autonomy and added New Haven to round out its
territory.</p><p align="justify">
    The New England colonies were highly sympathetic toward the
Puritan victors in the English Civil War. At the same time, they
welcomed the opportunity provided by the Commonwealth to assert
their political equality with England and consequently became
virtually independent between 1646 and 1660, at best with the
acquiescence of the new power in England. It was during this
period that the authorities in Massachusetts, beset by the
arrival or emergence of various kinds of Puritan sectarians,
particularly Baptists and Quakers, made their strongest efforts
to enforce religious orthodoxy within the colony. Their failure
was made complete when Charles II reestablished himself in the
mother country, actively asserted his authority over the
colonies, and decreed the end of persecution of heretics.</p><p align="justify">
    The struggle over orthodoxy during the period of generational
buildup was a reflection of the great challenge of the second
generation in New England. As the "saints" who pioneered the holy
commonwealth during the first generation died or removed
themselves from the active life of the community, their children
grew up without the same intense religious commitment or with
different religious ideas. Strictly speaking, this made them
eligible for admission into the covenant that could make them
citizens. They were thus relegated, with the real heretics, to
the peripheries of Puritan society.</p><p align="justify">
    Once the Puritan leadership discovered that it could not
suppress heresy or stimulate the same level of religious
inspiration among the sons as among the fathers, they had to find
a new way to bring men of good will into the community as
citizens. This was the task of the period of generational
buildup. It was accomplished in 1662 by the introduction of the
half-way covenant, the great political response of the second
generation, that provided citizenship in the political community
for those otherwise qualified who were unable to become
full-fledged Puritan "saints."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    In the years of political stability that persisted from the
mid 1660s to the outbreak of King Phillip's War in 1676, the New
England colonies expanded their settlements, accommodated their
religious differences, developed their confederacy, and attempted
to work out viable relations with royalist - and hence hostile-
England. Those years came to an end with the outbreak of the
great Indian war which introduced a new generation and a new set
of problems on all fronts.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    B. Government and the Economy:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The principal characteristic of the second generation was the
growth of commerce as a factor in the colonial economies and
increased influence of the commercial classes in political
matters. Even agriculture began to take on a commercial caste
with production for export as well as subsistence growing. In
Virginia commercial agriculture, particularly tobacco culture,
led to the foundation of plantations and the institutions of
permanent impact in the next generation. In New York,
agriculture was hardly a factor with commerce central to the
colony's existence. In New England, the growth of freehold
agriculture and growing commercial interests went hand in hand.</p><p align="justify">
    Government regulation of internal and external economic
activities remained pronounced. Government monopolies continued
to be common as were price controls. Mercantilism under the aegis
of the mother country was further institutionalized.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    C. Principal Ethno-Religious Manifestations:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The difficulties of maintaining orthodoxy were compounded in
the second generation by the continued influx of non-conformists,
sectarians and peoples of different ethnic and religious
backgrounds throughout the colonies. Not only Protestants of
every shade and Catholics came. At least two colonies had small
Jewish communities by the end of the generation. grudging
accommodation was the order of the day, a situation further
complicated by the interest of the English Crown in promoting
relative toleration for commercial reasons.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    While immigrants of English stock still predominated Dutch,
Swedes and Scots began to appear as more than isolated
individuals, not to mention the continued importation of blacks.
The second generation witnessed an increase in conflict with the
Indians as the settlers became more confidently aggressive and
the Indians began to see that there was no place for their way of
life in the new societies abuilding. The culminating events of
that generation were major Indian wars from north to south in
which the colonists won decisive victories that ended any
serious Indian threats to the future of their colonies.</p><BR>

                <H3><CENTER>The Third Generation (1677-1713)</CENTER></H3></p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    A. Major Political Patterns and Events:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The third generation, which closed out the seventeenth
century, was marked by the emergence of new colonies in all three
sections to virtually complete English settlement of the eastern
seaboard.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT> Whereas at the end of the second generation, only in
New England had the settlers broken out of scattered coastal
bridgeheads, by the end of the third generation, all but Georgia
of the original thirteen colonies had no coastline at all.
Moreover, while only New England had cross-colony interests at the
outset of the third generation, by mid-generation such interest
had been extended to embrace New York and New Jersey as well and
by the end of the generation, Queen Anne's War was well-nigh
universal in its impact to become the first "continental" issue
to confront the colonies.</p><p align="justify">



    Several other phenomena new to the third generation had
continental implications. The Huguenot migration after 1685 had
its impact on all three sections.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT> The "Glorious Revolution" of
1688 had continental repercussions and, indeed, triggered the
generation's years of political response. In the north, Governor
Andros was deposed and local self-government was restored. In the
south, the aftermath of the deposing of the Stuarts led to
constitutional changes in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas.
King William's War which began in 1689, and continued until 1697
was the first of the French and Indian Wars, which involved the
entire continent to a greater or lesser degree.</p><p align="justify">
    Last, but hardly least, efforts were made throughout the
entire generation to impose Anglicanism as the established church
from Maine to South Carolina. Wherever these efforts came up
against other established patterns of church-state relations,
they were soundly rejected sometimes only after serious conflict
and, in the case of North Carolina, open rebellion. At the same
time, the Anglican Church was successful in establishing toeholds
in colonies where it had previously been excluded. The struggle
over Anglican establishment in New England hastened the end of
Puritan dominance in that section.</p><p align="justify">
    Slavery as a permanent condition and a significant
institution was firmly established during the third generation.
The southern colonies, excepting only North Carolina, settled the
issues of the permanent bondage of blacks, slavery spread in the
Middle colonies and New England entered the slave trade.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
Otherwise, there was an expansion of non-English immigration
(Welsh, Scots, Huguenots, Germans) in all sections of the country
in the last half of the generation.</p><p align="justify">
    The third generation marked the beginning of the French and
Indian wars, global conflicts with special implications for North
America, which were to persist intermittently for two
generations. King William's War lasted from 1689 to 1697, through
the years of political response and Queen Anne's War picked up
the years of political stabilization from 1701 to 1713. The
Treaty of Utrecht which concluded the latter conflict, also
brought the seventeenth century to an end in both Europe and
America.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></p><BR>
<p align="justify">

 <H3>   B. Government and the Economy:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Completion of English occupation of the Atlantic seaboard
tightened the imperial control over colonial trade in the
mercantilist manner. In the South, the plantation owners
increased the political power at the expense of merchants and
freeholders, a reflection of shifts in the internal economies of
the Southern colonies. Commerce continued to be the central
consideration in the Middle colonies and became increasingly
important in New England as well.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

 <H3>   C. Principal Ethno-Religious Manifestations:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    This was the last generation of Puritan political dominance
in New England. It was marked by strong official efforts to
foster Anglicanism, struggles within the Puritan fold between
those who favored presbyterian organization and unreconstructed
congregationalists, and the witch trials. Both Puritan theology
and Puritan "blue laws" flowered in the struggle against
non-Puritan elements. All these reflected a generation of
religious crisis which traditional faith and the powers of the
leaders of the faithful were undermined.</p><p align="justify">
    In the middle colonies, religious pluralism was established
once and for all. It was even made the formal cornerstone of
Pennsylvania, Delaware and the Jerseys but was no less true of
New York. Indeed, religion was banished from the world affairs in
those colonies, made a private matter while political economics
became thoroughly secularized in spirit as well as practice.</p><p align="justify">
    In the South, old orthodoxies persisted more easily because
they were less demanding. The beginnings of Huguenot and
Scotch-Irish settlement in the southern or western areas of those
colonies led to the introduction of Calvinism on a very limited
scale but in territories relatively distant from the established
centers of Anglicanism.</p><p align="justify">
    Relations with the Indians in the third generation became
entangled with international politics as the great Indian nations
aligned themselves with the English or the French in the struggle
for control of North America that was to dominate two
generations. The Indians, allied with the French, became very
aggressive under stimulus from the allies, transforming a conflict
that had involved periodic wars with relatively peaceful
intervals into a well-nigh continuous scenario of raid and
counter-raid that greatly heightened the American's hostility
toward the red man.</p><BR>


         <H3><CENTER>      The Eighteenth Century (1714-1815)</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The three generations that comprise the eighteenth century -
the fourth, fifth, and sixth in American history - had as their
central task the founding of the American nation. At the
beginning of the century, the Americans-to-be were still
psychologically as well as politically divided by colonial
boundaries. Only one man, an anonymous Virginian, is known to
have publicly suggested federation of British North America and
his book remained in obscurity.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT> While the colonists had already
begun to share common problems and experience, they were
generally unaware that they did. By the end of the century, the
young American republic was clearly established under its own
federal constitution, had expanded its territory two-thirds of
the way across the continent, had waged two wars with Britain to
gain and maintain its independence, and was being viewed by the
wiser heads of Europe as a world power in the making.</p><BR>

<BR>
<p align="justify">
<H3>    A. Major Political Patterns and Events:</H3></p><p align="justify">    
    The treaty of Utrecht represented a great gain for Great
Britain, ratifying as it did its improved geopolitical status
that was the result of a generation of conflict, but it left the
precise boundaries between the French, Spanish and British
possessions undefined and thereby sowed the seeds for future
conflict on the basis of local issues. Among the formative events
was the Yamasee War between South Carolina and Florida Indians
allied with Spain that opened the door for the settlement of
Georgia during the years of generational response.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT> It was just
one of a series of localized Indian wars that took place on the
peripheries of colonial settlement throughout the generation.</p><p align="justify">



    In general, however, this first generation of the eighteenth
century was devoted to the quiet advance of the colonists. It was
in this generation that settlement advanced from the coastal
areas inland as far as the mountains so that, by the end of the
generation, the first crossings of the Appalachians were
inaugurating a whole new era of westward expansion.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT> Population
increased four-fold in this generation, from less than 360,000 to
nearly a million and a half. Cities developed that rivalled those
in England in size and sophistication and an urban culture was
established. America became an important factor in international
trade, primarily as an exporter of agricultural products.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The period of generational buildup was given over to these
developments. Philadelphia flowered as the country's major city
in what may well be called the "Age of Franklin", pioneering
modern urban living in a host of ways. Boston ceased to be a town
in all but name and form of government. New York expanded its
position as the commercial entrepot par excellence. Baltimore was
founded to handle the milling and export of flow from the new
hinterlands between the Potomac and the Susquehanna. Richmond
emerged as the first city of Virginia.</p><p align="justify">
    During the years of generational response, the Scotch-Irish
and the Germans settled the Piedmont frontier and the great
valleys that led southward from Pennsylvania to the Carolinas. At
the same time, the Yankees began their last wave of town-building
in southern New England and sent fingers of settlement into all
sections of northern New England. Georgia was founded and fought
a war with Spanish Florida to insure its survival. The Scots in
particular represented the new element. Mostly those who had
resisted the union of parliaments that eliminated Scotland's
autonomous governmental structure (in 1707, one of the
culminating event of the century in Britain), they were
implacably hostile to English rule anywhere.</p><p align="justify">
    At the same time, the English were attempting to consolidate
their rule in the colonies, converting proprietary colonies into
royal ones, strengthening the hands of the royal governors and
generally attempting to introduce more aristocratic elements into
the colonial governments. the colonial legislatures fought back,
strengthening themselves in the process, while the colonial
courts began to write colonial notions of liberty into the law
over the opposition of the governors, as in the Zenger case.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    After nearly three decades of peaceful consolidation, the
generation was brought to an end by nine years of intermittent
warfare (King George's War) that further consolidated the borders
of British America and set the stage for the final assault on
French Canada. For the first time, the Americans themselves bore
the brunt of the fighting outside of their boundaries and proved
themselves successful in the north and south wherever they were
led by their own commanders.</p><p align="justify">
    At the generation's end, young George Washington was setting
off for the Ohio River frontier and Benjamin Franklin was
proposing his Plan of Union at the first general congress of
colonial representatives. While neither effort was successful,
both marked turning points in the developing American nation.
</p><BR>
<p align="justify">
  <H3>  B. Government and Economy:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The British relaxed their mercantilist policies in the fourth
generation to allow the Americans a wider ambit for trading,
although under close Imperial regulation. The rum trade was
opened to the colonies and the American traders extended
themselves in many directions in the north and south Atlantic. In
general, the growing productive capacity of American agriculture,
the expansion of the new commercial cities in the colonies and
the introduction of more sophisticated machinery for processing
local natural resources made British America a more important ad
increasingly more equal trading partner.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    A wealth American merchant class began to develop with all
the accoutrements of such a class in the eighteenth century from
"respectable" religion (Anglicanism) to fancy dress balls. At
least in some quarters, the new colonial mercantile class began
to develop rivalries with their British counterparts and
dissatisfaction with the limitations of Imperial mercantilist
policies, even relaxed ones.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    C. Major Ethno-Religious Manifestations:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The great population increase of this generation was due to
heavy migrations from Scotland, Ulster, Ireland proper, and the
Germanies. While 60 percent of the population remained of English
stock, the fact that 40 percent was non-English by the end of the
generation was of great significance for America's future, not
the least because many of those who came were not only
uninterested in English rule, but actively opposed it. Most of
the new immigrants settled on the frontier but a significant
number rose to prominence in the cities as well, by exploiting
the commercial adjunct of the land frontier.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT>
    Religiously speaking, the great event of the generation was
the Great Awakening, the first great intersectional (if not
countrywide) revival which dominated the years of political
response.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">29</FONT></SUP> While the character and impact of the Great
Awakening are matters of some dispute, it is fairly well agreed
that it brought American another step down the road away from the
law-centered and society Puritanism of the seventeenth century
and toward the more individualistic and anti-nomian Protestanism
that was to become quintessentially American.</p><BR>


            <H3><CENTER>    The Fifth Generation (1754-1789)</CENTER></H3><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    A. Major Political Patterns and Events:
</H3></p><p align="justify">
    The fifth generation was responsible for the founding of the
United States.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT> The formative events and generational buildup of
that generation revolved around the last of the French and Indian
Wars and the elimination of the French as a North American Power.
The war itself began on the frontier in 1754 although officially
it did not begin until 1756. Between those two years, the
colonists were once again made painfully aware that the burden of
frontier defense against the Indians would be theirs unless and
until British imperial interests were more involved. Not only
could they not depend upon the mother country to protect their
interests on the frontier but there were even conflicts of
interest between them. The colonists also learned how vulnerable
the British could be through their experience with Braddock while
discovering that they had some special military capabilities of
their frontier experiences. Finally, for the first time, the
colonists and the imperial power were formally asked to consider
a plan of national federation, Benjamin Franklin's Albany Plan of
Union proposed in 1754 on the eve of the war as a defense
measure.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">

    By 1713, the French had been eliminated and the disposition
of the continent east of the Mississippi became a matter of issue
between the Americans and the British imperial authorities. The
issue was heightened because in the culminating events of the
previous generation the Americans broke the Appalachian barrier
so that settlers began to move west of the mountains as soon as
the war was over only find their way blocked by the British who
decided to keep the west wild for the fur trade. Thus the
question of western settlement became a key point of
confrontation during the generational buildup.</p><p align="justify">
    After the aftermath of the last French-and-Indian War also
brought with it the controversy over who was to pay for the
conflict and the struggle over colonial taxation which became the
proximate cause of the break with England. The series of
parliamentary tax measures added almost yearly increments to the
tension between colonists and mother country beginning with the
Sugar and Currency Acts of 1764 (the latter struck at the
established power of the colonies to issue paper money) and
continuing with the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts of
1767, the tea tax of 1770 and culminating in the Tea Act of 1773.</p><p align="justify">
    The main thrust of the generational buildup was in the
direction of American Independence combining as it did the
multiplication of controversies with Britain, the spreading sense
of American nationalism, and the emergence of an intercolonial
political structure to mobilize the public and to represent its
common interests. The two major prerevolutionary nationwide
"expressions of public will" were the Stamp Act Congress in 1765
and the first Continental Congress of 1774 which, in a very real
sense, anticipated the role played by critical presidential
elections after independence. The Stamp Act Congress was
essentially loyalist in its composition but it gave the
independence party a chance to organize on an intercolonial
basis. By the first Continental Congress, even though it, too,
took a generally loyalist stance, the men who were to vote for
independence two years later were already dominant.</p><p align="justify">
    The second Continental Congress initiated the years of
political response (1775-1781) whose central events were the War
and Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the Articles
of Confederation, the constitution that formalized the existence
of the United States as a "perpetual union". The decisive actions
taken in that period need hardly be mentioned. The Continental
Congress created an independent nation, gave it a constitution
and a government, established an army and navy, created a
monetary and banking system (the first bank in North America),
gave it the accoutrements of statehood, and assured that the
western lands would be a common national resource, all while
waging a war of independence. In a very real sense, this first
intensive period of national political response to the challenges
of the generation was paradigmatic of those that were to follow. </p><p align="justify">
    The years of political response were followed by the period
from 1781 to 1789 which, despite their reputation of years of
upheaval actually were years of political stabilization as the
country got on its feet and began to organize itself as an
independent nation. The newly ratified Articles of Confederation
were made operative and legislation effectuating the actions of
the Continental Congress was enacted, particularly in regard to
the western lands (the Northwest Ordinance of 1785 and 1787). A
favorable peace treaty with Great Britain "wrapped up" the War of
Independence and the last of the unreconstructed loyalists left
the country with considerable local encouragement.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The culminating events of the generation were fully in line
with the post-1781 trends. The constitutional convention of 1787
did not create a new union but in its own words, established a
"more perfect" one, ending the generation that struggled for
independence and opening the doors to the future for the new
nation under a more durable form of government.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    B. Government and Economy:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The political revolution of the fifth generation was
accompanied by an economic revolution as well. The colonialist
economic policies of the British were serious factors in
provoking the independence movement and greater opportunity for
international trade was a major American war aim. As soon as
conditions permitted, Americans began developing their
international trading capabilities. Internally, many of the most
powerful economic figures in the country remained loyalists and,
as a consequence, lost their positions and even their wealth,
leading to something of a redistribution of power - political and
economic - as a result of the war, the degree to which this was
so varied from state to state with the fewest changes coming in
the South where much of the planter class sided with the
revolutionaries. The greatest changes came in the Middle States
where many of the great merchants were Tories through and through
and were attacked as such. Finally, the triumph of the Americans
raised questions regarding intercolonial commerce that led
directly to the constitutional convention and the creation of
what may anachronistically be called the American "common
market".<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    C. Major Ethno-Religious Manifestations:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    Revolutionary changes in the patterns of church-state
relations accompanied the independence struggle. Most states
disestablished their churches during the course of the
generation, establishing governments that, while pledged to
support "religion and morality" were forbidden to support
particular denominations. Equal rights of citizenship were
extended to non-Protestants and non-Christians over most of the
new republic.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The war itself reflected the impact of the growing ethnic
diversity that was a particular feature of the eighteenth
century. Scots, for example, played an important role in the
conflict, displaying their strong anti-English feelings. Quakers
and the German sectarians, on the other hand, were generally
loyalists because of their general anti-war posture, if not their
prosperity under British rule. The war itself attracted military
figures from various parts of Europe to give the revolutionary
army a certain cosmopolitan veneer that would likely be
transformed into a part of the American tradition whereby every
ethnic group to settle in the country could find its special
Revolutionary War hero.</p><p align="justify">
    The revolution was also a partial revolution for the blacks
as well. Slavery was abolished in the North under the impetus of
the drive for equality and liberty and might even have
disappeared in the South had it not been for the invention of the
cotton gin and the opening of the western lands. This partial
victory was written into the Constitution as part of the
achievement of the revolutionary generation.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Most of the Indians sided with the British during the
Revolution, recognizing that the Americans were now their
implacable foes, wish it or not. The British, in turn, used them
for raiding on the frontier as the French had used their Indian
allies a generation earlier. As a result, the Americans adopted
an implacably hostile attitude toward all Indians which was
rapidly incorporated into the national policy of the young
Republic.</p><BR>


         <H3><CENTER>       The Sixth Generation (1789-1815)</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The major concern of the this, the first generation under the
Constitution was the establishment of the political institutions
and character of the new federal republic. This concern was
accompanied by more or less successful efforts to expand the
nation's borders and insure its independence from both Great
Britain and European wars in general. By the end of the
generation, the outlines of such institutions as the presidency,
congress and the judiciary were coming clear; the nature of the
federal-state relationship was well on its way to definition;
party politics had successfully taken root; and the continental
expansion of the United States was more or less assured.
</p><BR>
<p align="justify">
<H3>    A. Major Political Events and Patterns:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The sixth generation began with the adoption of the
Constitution in 1789 and its initial implementation by President
Washington and the First Congress during the next three years.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT>
These were founding events that not only gave that generation its
direction but shaped the subsequent framework of political life
in the Republic.</p><p align="justify">



    Already by the time of the writing of the Constitution, it
was apparent that the older generation of revolutionary leaders
was giving way to the younger men, the subalterns of the
Continental army or to men who had risen to prominence during the
Revolution itself. Indeed, now a few of the great revolutionary
leaders - men like Patrick Henry, George Mason and Samuel Adams -
opposed ratification of the Constitution and, for that reason or
some other, retired from the political scene after its adoption.
This process accelerated during the 1790s so that by 1800
Jefferson alone among the great revolutionary leaders remained
politically active and he had not emerged as a figure until 1776
when, as a 32 year old, he wrote the Declaration of
Independence.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    During that period of generation buildup (1789-1800) the
coalitions that had originally formed around the struggle over
ratification of the Constitution became institutionalized as the
Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. The party struggle
they initiated led the the first set of critical elections in
1796 and 1800, the first of which cemented the Jeffersonian
coalition even though the Federalists won while the second
shifted majority party status from the Federalists to the
Republicans.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The Jeffersonian political response to the problems of the
sixth generation came between 1801 and 1808, encompassing the
ratifying election of 1804 which Jefferson won by an overwhelming
majority. The response was less one of specific programs than one
befitting a still-young republic, namely the establishment of
ground rules for the transfer of national power from one party to
another, the firming up of the conditions of westward expansion
and the inauguration of the internal improvement movement.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The growing necessity for America to adjust to the changes in
the international balance of power as a result of the Napoleonic
wars led to a turning away from domestic issues and inaugurated a
period of political stabilization that lasted until the end of
the generation (1808-1815). The tabling of Gallatin's Report on
Internal Improvements (itself a hint of things to come in the
next generation) marked the end of the forward thrust of the
Republicans. From then on, foreign affairs culminating in the
inconclusive War of 1812 dominated the scene.</p><p align="justify">
    The war and its impact on the nation represented the
generation's culminating events. The need for national fiscal
controls and better internal communications opened the door to
an expansion of the federal role in domestic affairs in the next
generation while the failure of the Hartford Convention heralded
a shift of political power southward and westward, away from New
England.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    B. Government and the Economy:<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></H3></p><p align="justify">

    During this, the formative generation of the American
Republic, all governments pursued an activist policy designed to
regulate private enterprise in general while assisting in the
expansion of specific enterprises either through the grant of
monopolies or by joining with private parties in joint
enterprises. All planes of government were actively concerned with
improving the "economies" they served.</p><p align="justify">
    Government-chartered monopolies were common in all fields
requiring large scale organizations, with banking in particular a
governmental or quasi-governmental function. Where direct
government participation was involved, joint-stock companies,
created by combining government and private investment, were
established to undertake specific projects. A moderate protective
tariff was applied to maintain government economic and foreign
trade policies. Price regulation and market controls were common
on the local plane. Systematic use of the public domain for
development purposes was still in the future but specific
government land grants for specific projects were not uncommon.</p><BR>
<p align="justify">

<H3>    C. Principal Ethno-Religious Manifestations:</H3></p><p align="justify">

    The first generation under the constitution witnessed the
virtual completion of the movements to separate the American
churches from their English organizational ties and to
disestablish the state churches, which had begun in the
Revolutionary generation. By the generation's end, church and
state were formally separated in all but four states, though
informal supports continued to exist, particularly on the local
plane. disestablishment came in no little measure as a result of
triumph of unitarian and deistic ideas among the intellectual,
social and political leadership in the country and the spread of
Methodism (and, to a lesser extent, Baptism) among the common
people. Thomas Paine published his deistic-atheistic ideas at
the beginning of the generation and Jefferson gave expression
to his humanistic deism at its high point. In New England in the
early 1800s the Unitarians seceded from the orthodox churches in
a great schism.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    This final breakdown of the orthodoxies of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries made it well-nigh impossible for formal
religious establishment to be maintained in the states where it
had previously existed. Consequently, the pattern that already
prevailed in the pluralistic states, particularly New York and
Pennsylvania, was introduced in the others as well. That pattern
involved the localization of socio-religious subcommunity (or
perhaps more than one if they were all generally compatible)
would dominate a particular locality and informally maintain its
way of life as the norm there, thus creating a kind of
territorialistic pluralism that not only gave a special vitality
to territorial democracy but created a framework for the
assimilation of the immigrants from Europe that were to begin to
come in great numbers after the Napoleonic wars.</p><p align="justify">
    While the foregoing was transpiring on the ethno-religious
front,d the racial situation was undergoing a striking change as
well. At the very beginning of the sixth generation slavery was
abolished in the northern states while at the same time it became
profitable once again in the South. Whitney's cotton gin revived
a declining interest in slave labor below the Mason-Dixon line,
again ending an eighteenth century trend while at the same time
setting up the North-South division on the issue that was to form
the central political concern of the nineteenth century. The
eighteenth century spirit was to have one last nationwide victory
during the generation. As part of the "tidying up" of its
affairs, Congress in 1808 enacted legislation ending the slave
trade as provided in the constitutional compromise of twenty
years earlier.</p><p align="justify">
    The sixth generation also marked a shift in American
attitudes toward the Indians. At the beginning of the generation,
the tribes were still viewed as nations, essentially, the equals
of the United States in political relations if not in
civilization, capable of allying themselves with the Republic's
enemies. by the generation's end, they had been transformed in
the public mind into tribes, meaning primitive nuisances with
localized impact rather than threats to the Republic.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></p><BR>

       <H3><CENTER> Summary</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

This chapter discusses the American founding and the first two
centuries of the original American land frontier.  It begins with
the foundings of the thirteen original colonies, and continues
through the founding of the United States to the end of the War
of 1812, the second War of American Independence, and up to the
beginning of the American turn inward and the massive westward
movement of the nineteenth century.  These foundings and the
generational rhythms they generated, separately in the
seventeenth century and increasingly as one American rhythm in
the eighteenth, were based on the emergence of a common set of
challenges and responses shared by the emerging United States of
America.  The foundings and frontiers are discussed in terms of
the themes outlined in Chapter 2, looking at the internal rhythm
of each generation, founding, climactic and culminating events,
and their impact on American society, economy, culture,
federalism and religion, all within the context of their
political implications, manifestations and ramifications.
