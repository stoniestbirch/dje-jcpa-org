        No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government
    is not to trust it all to one, but to divide it among the
    many, distributing to everyone exactly the functions he is
    competent to do. Let the national government be entrusted
    with the defense of the nation and its foreign and federal
    relations; the State governments with the civil rights, laws,
    police, and administrations of what concerns the counties,
    and each ward direct the interests within itself. It is by
    dividing and subdividing these republics from the great
    national one down through all its subordinations, until it
    ends in the administration of every man's farm by himself, by
    placing under everyone what his own eye may super-intend,
    that all will be done for the best. What has destroyed
    liberty and the rights of man in every government which has
    ever existed under the sun? The generalizing and
    concentrating all cares and powers into one body, no matter
    whether of the autocrats of Russia or France, or of the
    aristocrats of a Venetian senate. An I do believe that if the
    Almighty has not decreed that man shall never be free, (and
    it is a blasphemy to believe it), that the secret will be
    found to be in the making himself the depository of the
    powers respecting himself, so far as he is competent to them,
    and delegating only what is beyond his competence by a
    synthetical process to higher and higher orders of
    functionaries, so as to trust fewer and fewer powers in
    proportion as the trustees become more and more oligarchical.
    The elementary republics of the ward, the county republics,
    the State republics, and the republic of the Union, would
    from a gradation of authorities, standing each on the basis
    of law, holding every one its delegated share of powers, and
    constituting truly a system of fundamental balances and
    checks for the government.

           --Thomas Jefferson to Joseph C. Cabell, Feb. 2, 1816 </p></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <p align="justify">  In the previous chapters we saw how the peoples who came to
America forged themselves into a single, if highly diverse,
nation, spreading that diversity unevenly across the continent to
give it a certain geographic basis. We also looked briefly at the
way in which the nation's diversity has acquired local expression
through the cultural streams and their political subcultural
differences that stop considerably short of separate nationhood.
(Even the South, the most distinctive of American sections, set
of as it is by a set of distinct historical experiences, is not a
separate nation.) Nevertheless, it is through territorial
democracy that we can see how the political culture is manifest
through political structure.</p><p align="justify">

    Territorial demography is closely linked with the principle
of federalism in American life. Beyond that, it is the American
expression of what popular writer Robert Ardrey has labelled the
"territorial imperative."<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>  As noted at the very beginning of
this book, living things, including humans, seem to have a need
to stake out a territory of their own in which they feel secure
to pursue their own interests and development. Here, too, the
American system seems to have been designed to make a special
effort to harmonize with human nature.</p><p align="justify">
    Territorial democracy as expressed through federalism is the
American way to attempt to accommodate these human needs.
Federalism also accommodates the need for a proper institutional
framework for democratic self-government.  In both respects,
federalism is the integrating principle of the American polity.
The patterns of religion, ethnicity, sectionalism, and political
culture, as well as territoriality, find their expressions
through the American federal system which has also come to play a
critical role in the generational rhythm of American politics.
In this chapter we will try to explore how the federal system
functions in this manner.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                       A System of Systems
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The realities of the American federal system only begin with
the relations between the national government and the states. The
states themselves are in many respects congeries of local
communities, cities, school and special districts and, in some
cases, townships or boroughs. In 1987, when they were last
counted, there were 83,186 such local governments within the fifty
states and the District of Columbia, as follows:<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></p><ul><LI><p align="justify">

    3,042  counties (called parishes in Louisiana and boroughs in
           Alaska) in every state but Connecticut and Rhode
           Island.</p><LI><p align="justify">
   19,200  municipalities (cities, boroughs, and incorporated
           towns) in all 50 states.</p><LI><p align="justify">

   16,691  townships (called towns in the six New England states,
           New York and Wisconsin; "plantations in some cases in
           Maine and "locations" in parts of New Hampshire); in
           21 northern states.</p><LI><p align="justify">

   14,721  school districts in forty-six states (all except
           Hawaii, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia where
           all public schools are managed by general government
           bodies).</p><LI><p align="justify">
   29,885  special districts in every state but Alaska, most of
           which were created for natural resource management,
           fire protection, water supply and other public
           utilities.  
</p></ul><p align="justify">
    Most Americans live within the jurisdiction of many local
governments simultaneously. One student of American federalism
identified the following constellation of jurisdictions to which
citizens in the particularly well-endowed suburb of Park Forest
south of Chicago paid taxes:</p><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">
    The United States of America<BR>

    The State of Illinois<BR>

    Cook (or Will) County<BR>

    Cook County Forest Preserve District<BR>

    Suburban Tuberculosis Sanitary District<BR>

    Rich (or Bloom) Township<BR>

    Bloom Township Sanitary District<BR>

    School District 216 (or 213)<BR>

    Rich Township High School District<BR>

    Elementary School District 163<BR>

    South Cook County Mosquito Abatement District<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></p>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">

    All of these local governments, whether they are general
purpose municipalities like the city of Chicago or very
specialized districts like the South Cook County Mosquito
Abatement District, are endowed with legal authority to act and
possess substantial powers to translate that authority into
reality to achieve the purposes for which they were created,
whether broad or limited. Somehow all of these governments have to
fit together in a system that will serve the differing needs of
the American people in their various capacities -- as citizens of
a single nation and fifty separate states, as residents of a
single nation and fifty separate states, as residents of specific
(and often complex) local communities, and as individuals with
family and group ties. These different capacities reflect varying
and at times contradictory loyalties and interests. Nevertheless,
they are all parts of a system of systems built around the
original and central political bargain that links the federal
government and the states.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                      Territorial Democracy
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    Common to all these governments is a territorial base that
is, their jurisdiction extends over a particular piece of
territory with definite boundaries. Now it is true that modern
governments in general tend to organize themselves territorially
so as to encompass all people resident within them equally. In
other epochs, governmental jurisdictions were designed to
encompass particular estates, ethnic communities, socio-economic
groups (guilds) or castes. The modern nation-state developed as
apart of an effort to do away with such forms.</p><p align="justify">
    Here, too, the United States is the epitome of modernism,
having never organized its population otherwise. In fact, the
American situation is just the reverse of the pre-modern
experience. Americans have frequently utilized territorial
divisions to make possible the autonomy of particular groups
rather than give those groups autonomy within shared territories,
precisely because of the principle that equality of political
attachment should prevail within every territorial jurisdiction.</p><p align="justify">
    The system of territorial democracy was further reinforced by
the agrarian foundations of American society. The country was
initially settled by people who earned their livelihood from the
land, most as farmers living on territorially bounded economic
unites. It was natural for them to base their new governments on
larger territorial units, each, in effect, an aggregation of the
smaller units within its compass.</p><p align="justify">
    Not only were the governmental units organized on a
territorial basis, but representation within them was also
territorially based. Representatives were elected from districts,
either following the political boundaries of constituent units or
drawn specially for the particular purpose at hand. As political
parties emerged, they developed parallel bases for their
organization.</p><p align="justify">
    The traditions of federalism combined with those of an
agrarian society have shaped political organizations in the
United States in a territorial mold. Hence, American politics is
organized around units of territory rather than economic or
ethnic groups, social classes, or the like. All such groups gain
formal representation in the councils of government through their
location in particular places and their ability to capture
political control of territorial units.  Alexis de Tocqueville
described the situation in the following manner in his classic
<I>Democracy in America:</I></p><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    In New England, townships were completely and definitely
    constituted as early as 1650. The independence of the township
    was the nucleus round which the local interests, passions,
    rights, and duties collected and clung. It gave scope to the
    activity of a real political life, thoroughly democratic and
    republican.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>
</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
    The phrase "territorial democracy" was coined by the American
journalist and political analyst Orestes Brownson in the 1850s.
He wrote that "the United States of America form a republic in
which territorial democracy prevails...."  Brownson contrasted
territorial with "Jacobin democracy," the infatuation with an
abstract, infallible People, and the concentration of "popular"
power in an absolute, centralized government. In contrasting
territorial with Jacobin democracy, Brownson used the terms
almost as a synonym for federalism. In theory, the two are not
quite the same but in the American system, where federal
democracy is expressed in the main through territorial divisions,
they come very close to coinciding.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    More recently, Professor Russell Kirk revived the concept
in somewhat different form.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT> Contemporary experts on the
political party system, emphasizing the degree to which both
access and representation<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT> in the American political system are
interwoven with the country's territorial divisions.  The struggle over reapportionment in the eleventh
generation was a dramatic example of how this is so. Since
territorial districts form the basis for political life, the
character of those districts is necessarily of central importance.
The drive for legislative reapportionment after World War II
culminated in a series of landmark decisions by the United States
Supreme Court starting in 1962 with the case of <I>Baker v. Carr.</I><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT>
This decision was based on the view that a system of state
legislative and congressional districts, which in most states had
gone unchanged for decades, or, if changed, had been done without
achieving population parity, was inherently undemocratic because
it denied citizens equal access.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">



    On the other hand, the argument against basing apportionment
strictly on equal population, or one-person, one-vote, also has
its roots in a conception of territorial democracy which holds
that pluralism is protected by the use of territorial divisions
to protect specific groups, interests, or ways of life. This
argument hold that there are polities, groups or interests that
deserve or require representation regardless of whether they meet
the minimum population requirements -- farmers who need
protection in an urban society, blacks who need representatives
of their own among a white majority, people from small cities in
a metropolitan environment -- and that the apportionment system
must take them into account.</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>            The Two Faces of Territorial Democracy<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT>
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
    Territorial democracy in America has two faces.  In its first
face, specific groups frequently choose to settle in specific
territories to create and maintain communities and to gain the
requisite political power to secure their common goals.  This
territorial distribution of power has served to mitigate the
effects of great national diversity by allowing subnational
territorial communities to interpret national demands in such a
way as to reflect their own local values as well.</p><p align="justify">
    The second and more frequently visible face of territorial
democracy emphasizes the openness of American communities.  In
the United States, most localities are open to virtually anyone
who chooses to settle within them, thereby enabling different
groups to gain political power or access to power simply by
virtue of their location.  In many ways this is the most neutral
kind of representation.  As soon as one interest declines in
importance and a new one rises, it can gain representation
because the people who make up that interest are located in some
particular political subdivision and can vote there.</p><p align="justify">
    The first face of territorial democracy was introduced by the
Pilgrims and Puritans, extended by various groups of settlers of
the West, and has been revived in our own times by some of the
advocates of black power, among others. This form of territorial
democracy has enabled diverse groups to maintain their own
respective integrities and particular ways of life while also
sharing in the larger American society.</p><p align="justify">
    In the days of the land frontier, it was assumed that people
with like backgrounds, views or interests would settle together
within the same political jurisdiction. If there were only a few
of them, they would settle a particular town or township; if
there were more, a whole county; and if there were enough; a
state. This pattern was most pronounced in the colonial period
when Massachusetts was founded by and for the Puritans; Maryland
by and for the Catholics; New Amsterdam, by and for the Dutch;
and so on. In the nineteenth century, the settlement of Utah by
the Mormons was the pronounced reflection of this pattern but so,
too, were the settlement of Alabama and Mississippi by people
from the lower southeast and the Dakotas by Scandinavians.</p><p align="justify">
    In New England, efforts were made to enforce uniformity
within political jurisdictions. Baptists were not welcome in
Congregationist Massachusetts and were forcibly evicted. However
the Puritan fathers did not particularly object to their
settlement of a new territory to the south, Rhode Island, where
they could follow their "heretical" ways. Connecticut was founded
by Puritans whose doctrine differed from those of the
Massachusetts "establishment."</p><p align="justify">
    This pattern of statewide conformity and interstate
differentiation soon proved untenable. There were just too many
people coming to the New World with too many different ideas. On
the local plane, however, the opportunities were nearly
unbounded, if not for complete homogeneity, at least for the
association of two or three compatible groups within a particular
locality. This latter pattern was spread across the continent in
the 19th century. given the limited population density of
agrarian settlement, it was possible to have "Protestant" or
"Catholic" towns and counties nearly everywhere and, in many
parts of the country the division was even finer -- whole
counties predominantly Baptist or Lutheran, not to speak of the
many settlements overwhelmingly populated by single ethnic groups
(e.g. the German cities, town, and counties that covered the
Mississippi Valley).<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Where religious or ethnic homogeneity was lacking, there was
often at least a homogeneity of interest, as in the case of the
cow towns and mining camps of the West or the coal and mill town
of the Northeast and South. The formal structure of government in
each of these territorial political communities was essentially
the same, varying only according to the sectional patterns that
emerged from the three "mother" political culture as they moved
westward. But within that formal structure, each community
provided its own content, utilizing the opportunities of
federalism to maintain local values and interests while
functioning as an integral part of the larger society.</p><p align="justify">
    The coming of the urban-industrial frontier made the
maintenance of this face of territorial democracy more difficult.
The densely populated cities that emerged in the 19th century did
not easily permit the separation of peoples necessary for its
maintenance. Still, in the smallest cities a great deal of
homogeneity could be obtained while in the largest, different
groups managed to create neighborhoods within which they could
preserve their own ways. The political organization of the great
cities reflected their desire to do so. The division of the city
into wards and the development of the political machine which was
almost invariably ward-based provided a vehicle for maintaining
sub-communities within the city. Ward leaders negotiating with
one another within the framework of the city's formal and informal
political structure could win for their constituents practical
control over everything from police to schools.</p><p align="justify">
    Thus, during the heyday of the urban-industrial frontier,
American cities offered opportunities for the maintenance of
territorial democracy. However, neighborhood autonomy led to a
conflict of political cultures and became suspect as a result.
Reformers seeking to restore "good government" attacked the
system which allowed the survival of neighborhood control. As
they succeeded in weakening or destroying the city political
machines, the possibilities for this face of territorial
democracy diminished. In this respect, the thrust upward and
outward into the larger American society of the various ethnic
groups provided additional support for the reformers' efforts.</p><p align="justify">
    Manifestations of the first face of territorial democracy can
be found in everything from liquor laws to racial discrimination.
Take the former. Some local communities and one state
(Mississippi) prohibit the sale of liquor within their
boundaries; others restrict the sale to state or municipal liquor
stores; others allow sales by the bottle but not by the drink.
Nor do the laws tell the whole story. In most states, enforcement
of liquor laws is informally left to local authorities who handle
it according to local mores and expectations. Thus the legal
prohibition in Mississippi is virtually not enforced in most
localities. In Iowa, Davenport and all of Scott County is allowed
greater discretion in selling liquor because it is generally
recognized that its population is more tolerant in such matters
than the rest of the state. In some communities with strong ethnic
traditions of regular drinking, but in moderation, even children
under age are informally allowed to imbibe.</p><p align="justify">
    In general, local option,<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT> either formal or informal prevails
in such matters, as it does in the matter of Sunday sales
limitations, gambling and many other issues involving cultural
standards and personal morality. Under the Constitution, the
states retain the power to regulate in these areas, subject only
to federal constitutional limits involving civil rights. In
practice, the states tend to delegate these regulatory powers to
their local subdivisions. Here sectional and political factors
play a role. Southern states tend to enact very specific
legislation in this area and then allow their localities to
enforce it or not. Western states tend to keep both state and
local legislation in these areas to a minimum, to allow a maximum
of private choice, formally as well as informally. The northern
states inherited a great deal of restrictive legislation from
their early days and now enforce it in a mixed manner, to the
extent that U.S. Supreme Court decisions have not undercut
enforcement of blue laws.</p><p align="justify">
    The "noble experiment" with nationwide prohibition of the
sale or consumption of liquor between 1920 and 1933 through the
Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution was a clear violation of
the idea of territorial democracy. Its total failure has
generally served as an object lesson for Americans as to the
limits of government intervention into private morality. It
should also serve as an object lesson regarding the limited
possibility of developing a single national standard in such
matters. Prohibition was an example of the unnecessary
application of a single moral standard by law, in part occasioned
by the desire of an older, rural America to secure a symbolic
victory over the newer, urban American with its lower level of
social control.</p><p align="justify">
    Americans are now dealing with a similar case, albeit in
reverse. Until 1957, regulation or prohibition of pornographic
material was left to local authorities who set policy according
to the standards then prevailing in their localities. So, for
example, "hit" plays in New York could be banned in Boston. Then
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that "contemporary community
standards" were to be defined in terms of the national
community.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    This decision was expanded over the following fifteen years
to cover most of communications media, most particularly
publishing and films, only to lead to a double set of problems.
On one hand, the Court itself had to become ad de facto national
censorship board as it was called upon to review case after case
in which publishers and film-makers attempted to eliminate
restrictions nationwide, and was overwhelmed by the burden. On
the other hand, as the tastes of the most "with-it" sectors of
American society began to be imposed on the rest of the country,
there was a popular outcry of growing proportions. Finally in
1973, the Court found it necessary to restore the rights of the
states and communities to apply their own standards, within
certain broad limits,<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT> demonstrating in another way the utility
of territorial democracy as a means of providing for the
expression of widely divergent viewpoints in a large and diverse
country with a minimum of conflict.</p><p align="justify">
    If territorial democracy offers opportunities for the
maintenance of necessary and proper diversity, it also enabled
some segments of the population to discriminate against other
segments, particularly in the South. In this respect, it is like
every other human institution, capable of being used for good or
ill. For the better part of the past two centuries, whites used
their dominant position in the Southern states to oppress blacks,
first through slavery and then through racial segregation. Moreover,
except during the Civil War and Reconstruction, the majority in
the North avoided interference in their practice on the grounds
of "states rights," one aspect of territorial democracy. The
freedom of action of the territorial polities in this sphere was
progressively limited beginning in the 1920s on constitutional
grounds and eliminated as an option by the Supreme Court's school
desegregation ruling in 1954 and subsequent civil rights
decisions.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    In this case, as in the others, the principle of checks and
balances allows for intervention when on constitutional principle
is used in practice to violate another. At the same time, the
original principle itself is not destroyed, only redirected.
While maximum federal pressure was brought to bear on the states
and localities that maintained racial segregation through a
combination of legal and other means, the ultimate responsibility
for desegregation was necessarily left to the territorial
polities in line with constitutional requirements. The federal
Supreme Court could hold that Alabama was acting
unconstitutionally when it maintained segregated schools; the
Congress of the United States could enact legislation cutting off
federal aid to segregated schools; the President could even send
troops to protect the civil rights of black students, but under
the Constitution, there was no way for the federal government to
open its own schools in Alabama or forbid the state to maintain
its school system.</p><p align="justify">
    Thus, in the end, change had to be effected through
intergovernmental cooperation, albeit antagonistic cooperation in
this case. This may or may not have meant that desegregation took
longer to be achieved (there is no way to be certain that
desegregation by federal order coupled with the exercise of force
would not have provoked even greater resistance on the part of
Southern whites and thereby prolonged the struggle for equality).
Its ultimate achievement took place in such a manner that a
consensus was developed, with most Southern whites ultimately
persuaded of the justice of the change, even if they did not like
it personally, and thereby were more willing to support it.</p><p align="justify">
    A key element in the desegregation struggle was the opening
of the ballot box to blacks in the southern states, just as the
anti-slavery struggle a century earlier had to culminate in the
institution of constitutional guarantees for black
enfranchisement in the country as a whole. The importance of the
right to vote in local, state and national elections is directly
connected to territorial democracy.</p><p align="justify">
    Access to the country's political mechanisms, a crucial
concern for those seeking to gain their place in the sun, has
always involved location in territorial units of government.
Recent black gains in the protection of their constitutional
rights on the federal plane, for example, are being translated
into political realities because of their concentration in
certain territories where they can gain important local
representation and also make their numbers count for more than
their 12 percent of the nation's total population. By obtaining
the ballot in the Southern states where they form majorities in
some counties, they have been able to gain significant
representation in local offices and a voice in state politics.</p><p align="justify">
    That potential is illustrated by the political career of
Alabama's late governor George Wallace.  Wallace rose to power in
the 1950s on a typical southern populist platform, combining
attacks on privilege with low-key racism.  Seeing the opportunity
to strengthen his power base by opposing the federal government
over the issue of racial desegregation, he took up the cudgels
for "the southern way of life" and demonstrably stood in the
doorway of the University of Alabama to prevent blacks from
enrolling.</p><p align="justify">
    His success with his constituency led him to take his racist
campaign nationwide.  Twice he tried to run for the presidency of
the United States.  At his high-water mark he received 14 percent
of the vote nationwide. (The results of the election offer a very
good illustration of the location of the traditionalistic
political subculture in the United States.) Then he was shot in
a would-be assassination attempt, returned to Alabama, and,
semi-paralyzed, successfully ran again for governor.  </p><p align="justify">
    By this time the tide had turned on racial matters, blacks
had begun to vote, and Wallace needed their support.  In his new
incarnation he became the blacks' best friend, gave them jobs in
his administration, and returned to the University of Alabama to
bestow his blessing on the university's first black homecoming
queen, receiving in return the blessing of leading civil rights
activist Charles Evers.  In a way this was political cynicism
refined to a high art.  In another way it was a reflection of the
impact of the democratic process in bringing politicians to
adjust to changing realities as expressed through territorial
democracy.</p><p align="justify">
    In the northern and western states, the sheer increase in
their numbers has transformed them into a potent bloc,
particularly in the major cities where they now comprise
one-fourth  to over one-half of the total population.  Until the
1960s, black city council members were hard to find; by the
1980s, blacks had been elected mayors in most, including all the
biggest ones.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The neutrality of territory has reinforced the second face of
territorial democracy so that it remains the fundamental basis
for political representation even in today's highly urbanized
America. Thus the federal protection of Southern blacks' rights
to vote has meant that they have gained a certain potential
political power automatically (like all other groups) because the
permanent boundaries of the states and the well-nigh permanent
boundaries of their major subdivisions serve as major mechanisms
for access to positions of influence as well as strong bulwarks
for the diffusion of power. As permanent boundaries, they offer
continued opportunities for diverse interests to exercise power
without fear of retribution form "higher authority" while,
possessing the neutrality of so-called "artificial boundaries,"
they prevent the confinement of power to select interests. Since
every interest, new or old, is located willy-nilly in some
formally-defined political territory, simply by making use of the
country's political mechanisms, each can potentially make its
voice heard.</p><p align="justify">
    The state of Florida, for example, once a typical
representative of traditional Southern interests, now speaks for
the pioneers of the space frontier and the new world of leisure.
Detroit, Michigan was a locus of power for Yankee commercial and
craft interests in the 19th century. With its economic
transformation into an automobile center, it was politically
transformed into a stronghold for "ethnic" and black autoworkers
without having to alter significantly its basic political
structure or institutions. Blacks, some of whom felt the need to
riot in 1968 to make themselves heard, first elected one of their
own (Coleman Young) as mayor of Detroit in 1973, within the same
boundaries and under the same ground rules.</p><p align="justify">
    Even in the colonial period, the face of territorial
neutrality developed side by side with the face of territorial
communalism. The middle states, in particular, emphasized
pluralistic settlement in their territories. Ultimately, all the
states followed their lead to a greater or lesser degree. In the
end, with a few exceptions, most political units have some
characteristics of both faces, functioning as neutral arenas to
the extent that they are open to all who seek to settle within
them and, at the same time, as communities to the extent that
those who do settle within them seek to use their political
structure to maintain their own values or way of life.</p><p align="justify">
    The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states and localities
cannot formally prohibit American citizens from settling in their
midst, although they can regulate some conditions under which
they can settle.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT>At the same time, on the most immediately
local plane, informal methods have been devised to keep
communities more or less homogenous, ranging from outright
violence against "undesirables" to more subtle devices such as
control of home sales and rentals or simply excluding those who
"do not fit" from the local and social networks.  Most of these
devices also have been challenged in the courts and ruled
unconstitutional or legally unenforceable.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT>  Many have been
outlawed by state and federal legislation.</p><p align="justify">
    Rural America still retains much of the first face of
territorial democracy. It is most evident among such truly
separatist groups as the Amish, but is equally strong in
communities that consider themselves full participants in
American life while still preserving their own variant of
American mores. It, too, is under pressure as a result of the new
style settlement movement.</p><p align="justify">
    The opening of the metropolitan-technological frontier
brought with it renewed opportunities to strengthen both faces of
territorial democracy. On one hand, the new mobility led to a
breakdown of many territorially-based local communities.
Out-migration from rural areas and older urban neighborhoods
depleted old, established ones while in resettling themselves,
the migrants often upset other communities. On the other hand,
the settlement of the suburban frontier with its opportunities
for the development of many politically separate suburbs within a
metropolitan areas, created new opportunities for the development
of territorial polities consisting of peoples with similar
backgrounds and values. In some cases, specific ethnic or
religious groups settled together in suburbs; in others,
political or economic homogeneity was the source of local unity.
Indeed, suburbia has been attacked in some quarters for fostering
communities in which one group or another isolates itself to
maintain its own particular patterns of life, whatever they might
be.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The attacks on suburban self-segregation reflect a
significant aspect of the ideology of the
metropolitan-technological frontier, namely that traditional
group distinctions which lead to segregation, even
self-segregation, are anti-democratic and should be broken down.
This ideology emerged out of the struggle to eliminate the
divisions in American life between the older, white Protestant
"establishment" and the newer ethnic groups and previously
excluded racial groups. It is oriented toward the use of
territorial democracy in the most neutral manner. Despite their
acceptance of the ideology, many, if not most American still
retain a pragmatic desire to use their territorial polities to
protect real interests, using a variety of means, such as police
and zoning powers to preserve local control. Those who do not
have the opportunity to control their own politics -- inner city
blacks, for example -- seek equivalent opportunities through
demands for community control.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT>

<H3><CENTER>      The States as the Keystones in the Governmental Arch
</CENTER></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="justify">

    [The word state] describes sometimes a people or community of
    individuals united more or less closely in political
    relations, inhabiting temporarily or permanently the same
    country; often it denotes only the country or territorial
    region, inhabited by such a community; not infrequently it is
    applied to the government under which people live;...In the

</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
   The fifty American states, located between the powerful
federal government and the burgeoning local governments in a
metropolitanized nation, are the keystones of the American
governmental arch. This was the case when the Constitution was
adopted in 1789 and remains true despite the great changes that
have taken place in the intervening years.</p><p align="justify">
    This assertion if had been made at the end of the eleventh
generation of American history or even early in the twelfth,
while true then as well as now, would have been greeted with
disbelief.  Today, as the combination of the failures of the
federal government at the end of the eleventh generation, the
Reagan revolution at the beginning of the twelfth, and the
natural rhythm of the generations which emphasizes the resurgence
of state and local powers in the periods of generational
consolidation and generational build-up, has created a situation
in which the states have once again become the leading innovators
and sources of energy in American government.  Nevertheless, if
this assertion were based upon an analysis of the present
position of the states in light of formal constitutional
interpretations alone, there would be great difficulty in
substantiating it. In fact, the states maintain their central
role because of their structural and political position in the
overall framework of the nation's political system, a position
supported by the Constitution but which transcends its formal
bounds.</p><p align="justify">
    By structural position we mean the very existence of the
states with their own political institutions, tax bases, and
congeries of interests that make them players in the American
game of government.  By political we mean the power of the states
and their representatives operating through the political process
to make their demands felt and to satisfy their needs.</p><p align="justify">

    Unlike the more or less visible constitutional status of the
states, their structural and political position is generally of
low visibility, not only to the public at-large, but often even
to those people involved in the day-to-day operations of American
government.</p><p align="justify">
    When we speak of a state's doing this or that or taking one
position or another and of states responding to federal actions
in different ways, we are, like Chief Justice Chase, using a
convenient way of speaking about the actions of those people and
interest within each state's civil society that dominate its
political system. This does not mean that the dominant forces
leading a state represent all or even a majority of the citizens
of their state every time they act in its name. Cross-pressures
of varying degrees exist within each state on every issue. On
most issues that attract nationwide attention, the
cross-pressures extend across state lines. This means that
contesting groups within the state's civil society may
momentarily find they have more in common with their counterparts
in other states than with their immediate compatriots. </p><p align="justify">

    Nevertheless, there are a wide range of issues in which the
dominant interests in any state can act as if they had statewide
consensus behind them. These include some substantive issues in
which the welfare or interests of the bulk of a state's citizenry
are clearly involved (such as state economic development),
certain fundamental procedural issues that are important because
they concern the maintenance of the state itself (such as the
right of the state to determine the terms of employment in its
government), and at least a few issues which, while not
necessarily reflecting a "state" interest as such, do reflect the
opinions of a solid majority of the state's citizens (such as the
general antigovernment bias widespread among citizens of the
sparsely populated states of the mountain-and-plains West or the
racial bias of the white majorities that once was so powerful in
the southern states).</p><p align="justify">
    Proper use of the systemic aspects of a state's civil society
enhances the possibility for the people and interests dominating
the state's political system to speak in the name of their state.
There is a wide variety of ways in  which each state, as a
reasonably autonomous civil society, can capitalize on its
potential for internal unity in the face of outside pressure.
States can take appropriate legislative and executive action.
Local official can enforce regulations and ordinances that, taken
at face value, seem irrelevant to the issue at hand but can be
applied discreetly in a relevant way. Private exercise of
property and personal rights backed by state and local law
enforcement agencies can be used as a countervailing power.</p><p align="justify">
    Nor is this ability simply a matter of negativism, of
opposition to national goals or norms. Minnesota protects itself
against organized crime by a combination of the same instruments:
state legislation against the "betting" sports -- horse and dog
racing, a vigilant and uncorruptable judicial system cooperating
among local law enforcement officers to expel "undesirable
elements" when they enter the state, and an attitude among the
citizenry that provides both tacit and active support for the
state's activities. In a more subtle way, Oregon mobilizes its
resources as a state to maintain its "pristine" character by
encouraging environmental protection and discouraging economic
development that might bring an influx of new settlers in the
pattern of California and Washington, its two principal
neighbors. Even a highly diverse state like New York is capable
of this kind of mobilization when its hegemony as the nation's
economic and cultural center is in question.</p><p align="justify">
    Take a different kind of case involving defense against
"outside encroachment." State law enforcement agencies are often
able to reshape certain Supreme Court rulings on criminal
procedures if they can foster agreement among the courts, the
prosecutors, the police, and the bar at the state level and in
the state's communities as to how the individual's basic rights
are to be protected under the state's scheme and what discretion
law enforcement agencies are to be allowed.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The state's formal constitutional position, taken alone,
would hardly be an adequate line of defense in cases where they
have a paramount interest in preserving local patterns or
customs, just as (to take a far different example) the states
have no constitutional guarantee that their citizens will receive
a specific share of federal defense expenditures. Even the
states' role at the center of the nation's party system would not
provide sufficient defense against concentrated national pressure,
though it helps considerably. The states' first line of defense
(or, in the case of the defense contracts, offense) lies in their
ability to function as civil societies, to mobilize many facets
of their internal and external powers through their own
political systems to resist "encroachments" (or to gain benefits)
from the outside.</p><p align="justify">
    In the militant states of the South, the state police, the
local school boards, the senators in Washington, the governor,
the local fire inspectors, the network of Citizens Councils, all
joined together to fight desegregation after 1954, so much so that
federal authorities, including the courts, implicitly recognized
that those states were functioning as civil societies in this
way, stamping as equally unconstitutional both direct state
action and private actions sanctioned by the states and serving
to reinforce racial segregation. In every state, relevant groups
of similar diversity -- the state's economic development agency,
state and local chambers of commerce, the governor and the
mayors, and the state's representatives in Congress -- join to
secure defense contracts, federal installations, or public works.</p><p align="justify">

    More recently this kind of effort has been mobilized for
purposes of economic development, especially in the way of
exports to foreign countries and foreign investment.  This
foreign economic activity may well be the new frontier of the
states as civil societies.  States not only serve their own
interests but play a role of critical national importance, so
recognized by the federal government as one which only they can
perform well.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    The states are also once again becoming more visible as civil
societies in matters of life style issues where moral questions
are involved.  While less differentiated than they used to be in
matters related to gambling and liquor consumption, they are more
differentiated in matters of abortion rights, control of
obscenity and pornography, with regard to matters involving
sexual preference, and similar concerns of the new-style
politics.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT> It is their ability to join together and to fight
their common battle on a number of fronts that has given certain
states such a large measure of success in these various
endeavors.

<H3><CENTER>                 The States as Political Systems
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The ways by which the states and localities organize
themselves as political systems to exercise power within the
national political system are vitally important to the
functioning of American government.</p><p align="justify">
    The term "state," as used in the United States, can be said
to refer to those people, interests, and institutions that at any
given time are bound together within the territory organized
constitutionally as a particular state and who are capable of
speaking for the political system of the state in question. No
state speaks for any specific ethnic racial or religious group or
interest, per se, since the people not the states maintain
separate identities apart from their common American identity.
People do identify with their states, often very strongly.
Texans, Virginians and Californians are expected to have highly
developed sense of state identity. Southerners tend to maintain a
sense of themselves as citizens of their state. Coloradans and
Minnesotans have equally avid, if less well-known, state
attachments. but in no case, not even among Hawaiians or Alaskans,
odes state identity stand apart form their sense of being
Americans; rather, one's state attachments are generally
considered to be a function of one's being an American. If
nothing else, the migratory habits of Americans tend to
discourage any such development.</p><p align="justify">
    Consequently, there is no authentic way to determine which
people, interests and institutions speak for a particular
state at any given time. Certainly, no particular group or
institution can claim to be the custodian of a state "ism" or
culture. While the likelihood is that the governor and the
legislator will be a state's prime spokesmen, that is not always
the case. Courts, political leaders, heads of government
departments, important interest groups, even public opinion
broadly defined may speak for the state in particular instances.
It is under these conditions that each state's existence as a
civil society -- a complex social institution organized for
civil, or political, purposes -- becomes clear.</p><p align="justify">
    The political system of each state can be said to include the
following components:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">

    The state government in its several branches and parts
       (including its local parts).</p><LI><p align="justify">

   Those agencies of the federal and local governments which,
       though not formally attached to the state government,
       function primarily to serve the state and its citizens
       (e.g. the U.S. District Court for the state).</p><LI><p align="justify">
The public non-governmental institutions organized on a
       state-wide basis which serve the states' civil society
       (e.g. the state Red Cross).</p><LI><p align="justify">

   The state's political parties.</p><LI><p align="justify">

  The various interests regularly concerned with and
       involved in the state's political life for reasons of
       their own (e.g. the state trade and labor council).</p></ol>
<p align="justify">

All of these components have some place in the state's
constitution, both in the immediate sense of the document setting
forth its frame of government and in the larger sense of the
documents and traditions which define the state's particular
orientation as a civil society.</p><p align="justify">
    In each state the various institutions, organization, groups,
individuals and values involved in these components form the
basis for the network that is the state's political system, that
makes it civil society function in pursuit of its civic goals,
even while the state is an integral part of the nation. Not every
state functions as a unit to the same degree. Some choose not to
do so by design and occasionally by default. Obviously, the more
successful a state is in formulating common goals shared by the
greater part of its citizenry, forging a network of institutions
that embraces all the variegated elements within its boundaries,
and utilizing its own government to set its pace as a state, the
more important it will be to its citizens and the better able it
will be to promote those goals.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                  The States as Civil Societies
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The subtle and sometimes-not-so-subtle differences among the
states are worth noting and considering as part and parcel of any
discussion of American politics. Every state has its own
distinctiveness -- in the composition of its people, in its
political goals and processes, and in the way in which its people
respond to those goals and processes. Yet those differences are
not like the differences between the six republics (states) of
Yugoslavia, each of which represents a different nationality
within that union. Nor do they even approach the differences that
set Quebec apart from the rest of Canada.</p><p align="justify">
    Every state has its own character as a civil society because
it has its own laws, institutions and history (or, better,
geo-historical location). Some enjoy the advantage of being
easily perceived as distinctive by their citizens and other. Some
are not easily seen in a distinctive light but, on closer
examination, their distinctiveness becomes visible. What every
state does have is a history of its own which continues to shape
future events; its own legal system which set the framework for
so much of the economic and political activity; and its own
conception of justice upon which it builds its social and
economic policies as a state. As a civil society every state has
its own means of organizing power, developed over time and, in
part, encapsulated in its system of laws. Each also has its own
conception of justice, manifested through its policies and their
manner of execution.</p><p align="justify">
    What, then, is the substance of state differences? We can
identify several ways in which particular states are unique. They
include:</p><p align="justify">
    <OL type="1">
	<LI>  Substantial cultural distinctiveness
	<LI>  Substantial and self-conscious public attachment
	<LI>  A widely shared sense of a common historical experience of
	<LI> substantial worth or distinctiveness
	<LI>  Substantial state distinctiveness in policy matters
	<LI>  Substantial geographic isolation and/or distinctiveness.
</OL></p><p align="justify">
These five categories frequently reinforce one another.</p><p align="justify">
    Some examples are in order. Perhaps the most distinctive
state is Utah. Its overwhelmingly Mormon population is more
internally homogeneous than that of any other state end, at the
same time, very different from any of its sisters. As the Mormon
"homeland," its citizens are self-consciously identified with it
as a state and with its history as the center of Mormonism.
Because of the special role of the Mormon church, Utah maintains
very distinctive governmental policies, internally and
externally. Finally, Utah is geographically one of the most
isolated and self-contained of the states; the Mormons chose to
settle where they did for precisely that reason.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    California is another highly distinctive state, but in the
mainstream (if not the avante garde) of American life. The
"California way of life" is a well-recognized American
subculture. Californians identify strongly with it and with their
state as its home. The state pursues distinctive policies,
especially in the realm of social relations, that flow from that
way of life and support it. California's history has acquired an
especially romantic flavor in the minds of its people, who follow
it avidly, while its geographic character and position give it a
measure of separation from the rest of the country.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Minnesota is as distinctive as California but in a low-keyed
way. It gains room for its distinctiveness from its geographic
position away from the country's mainstream. Its government has
consistently pursued distinctive policies, especially in the
areas of education, social welfare, and human rights. The state
has a special ethnic heritage that is well-known yet the
political culture of its population is as homogenous as that of
Utah because of the cultural convergence of the streams that
settled it. Moreover, Minnesotans are highly conscious of their
distinctiveness and of the virtues of their state, especially
after they travel outside of its boundaries. The weakest link in
this chain is that, while Minnesotans have been conscious of
their history from the first (one distinctive feature is that the
state's oldest institution is the Minnesota Historical Society),
they do not have a real sense of how unique it is.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    On the other end of the scale, New Jersey is usually pictures
as an artificial and even accidental creation with no real
identity of its own.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT> The picture is not entirely false, but it
overlooks a very real coherence within the Garden State forged
out if its historical experiences. From its first settlement in
the 17th century until the end of the eleventh, New Jersey was a
satellite of New York City and Philadelphia, with its northern
half pulled toward the former and its southern half toward the
latter. It was so much a "colony" of its neighbors, that it
depended upon them for its mass media, having no major newspaper,
radio or television station within its boundaries. Yet as a
result of its historical experience, the state acquired a
personality of its own. Its people share a common pattern of
settlement in small cities and towns; they are heavily
suburbanite in their orientation; they join together to oppose
substantial state taxation, preferring to maintain a relatively
low level of public services instead. At the same time, they rely
upon their state government for far more than do the two cities
in New York and Pennsylvania which function as their states'
centers of gravity.</p><p align="justify">
    The twelfth generation has marked the turning point for New
Jersey. Today the state is coming into its own as the very enter
of action on America's "main street."  The headquarters of major
corporations moved from New York City across the Hudson. New
Jersey acquired some major sports teams (some of which still were
identified as New York teams even though they play in the Garden
State). A political leadership visible for its progressiveness
and quality emerged and attracted national attention. New Jersey
finally acquired television service of its own. By the middle of
the 1980s the rurban-cybernetic frontier epitomized New Jersey's
pattern of settlement and suddenly the state found itself as the
heartland of the new frontier. Its people began to develop a new
sense of identity, purpose, and state pride.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
    Similarly, Ohio has a certain anonymity as a state, fostered
by its location well within the mainstreams of American life.
Contrast Ohio's stance in defining the state's role with that of
Minnesota. In Ohio, it has been assumed that the basic task of
state government is to create a proper climate for business to
prosper on the assumption that such prosperity will lead to
general prosperity in the state as a whole, leaving to its many
different cities and counties the task of defining what
constitutes the good life for their residents. Thus Ohio has
consistently pursued a tax policy that favors business investment
and has widely advertised that fact. Or, in a slightly different
context, Ohio began to provide substantial support for higher
education when it became clear that good universities were an
integral part of the "package" needed to attract growth
industries.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT> In the Gopher State (Minnesota), it has long been
assumed that state government exists to equalize opportunity and
benefits even at the expense of what is often termed "a good
business climate." It has levied taxes accordingly, with a
steeply progressive income tax at the core of its revenue raising
system. Moreover, the state has always supported higher education
handsomely because its people believe in the social and moral
efficacy of education.</p><p align="justify">
    In sum, every state has its own particular identity matched
by the realities of its distinctiveness. In many cases, that
identity is widely perceived. What does "Texas" evoke as an
image" Virginia? Indiana? Hawaii? Vermont? In these cases the
image is clear, but even where it is not, a moment's reflection
does bring something special to mind. And behind that "something
special" there is a reality forged by history, geography and
culture and embodied in particular patterns of political
organization focusing on a particular conception of justice.

<H3><CENTER>          The Federal System and the Political Setting
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    Each of the 50 states responds to the intergovernmental
system described in the foregoing chapters in its own way.
Understanding their responses requires an appreciation of (1) the
way in which the states' functioning as political systems
influences the operations of the general government; and (2) the
way in which the states -- still functioning as political systems
-- adapt national programs to their own needs and interests.  For
such an appreciation, it is first necessary to understand the
fundamental social and political factors that serve to shape the
states and the political setting in which they operate.</p><p align="justify">
    The three overarching factors of political culture,
sectionalism, and the continuing frontier appear to be especially
important in shaping the individual states' political structures,
electoral behavior, and modes of organization for political
action. All three of these factors represent dynamic processes
that generally act upon the states and the federal system, and
interact with one another in ever-changing ways.  The three
factors embrace and shape and primary social, economic, and
psychological thrusts that influence American politics.  Indeed,
it is suggested here that other factors, often presented as basic
to the shaping of political systems, and ranging from the class
system to urbanization, can best be understood in light of these
three factors and are accordingly secondary in their influence.</p><p align="justify">
    Political culture is particularly important as the historical
source of differences in habits, perspectives, and attitudes that
influence political life in the various states.  Sectionalism is
particularly important as a major source of geographically rooted
variations that influence state-by-state differences in responses
to nationwide political, economic, and social developments.  The
frontier is particularly important as the generator of the forces
of change.  These forces influence patterns of settlement and
human economic, social, and political organization throughout the
federal system; they stimulate governmental action in new fields
on all planes, and consequently force the continual readjustment
of the federal balance.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                Federalism and Political Culture
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    One of the observations coming out of the various studies of
state-federal relations is that the states themselves (or their
local subdivisions) well-nigh shape the impact of federally aided
activities within their boundaries.  Take the case of the impact
of federal aid on the administration of state government.  In
those states where the executive branch is organized along
hierarchical lines and the governor is usually strong, federal
aid has tended to strengthen executive powers by giving the
governor more and better tools to wield.  In those states where
power is widely diffused among the separate executive
departments, federal aid has tended to add to the diffusion by
giving the individual departments new sources of funds outside of
the normal channels of state control.  These can be used to
obtain more money and power from the legislature.  In those
states where earmarked funds reflect legislature or lobby
domination over programs, earmarked federal funds follow the same
pattern.  Despite many protestations to the contrary, only in
rare situations have federal grant programs served to alter state
administrative patterns in ways that did not coincide with
already established state policies, although such grants have
often sharpened certain tendencies in state administration.</p><p align="justify">
    During the past generation, in state after state,
constitutions were revised, gubernatorial tenure and powers were
strengthened, legislative sessions were lengthened, legislators'
salaries were increased, and state tax systems were overhauled.
While indirect federal influence, in the sense of U.S. Supreme
Court decisions or the threat of federal encroachment on their
prerogatives, should not be ignored, and strengthened the states'
desire to maintain their position in the Union by modernizing,
these changes were self-generated and were not the result of any
direct influence by federal authorities or programs.</p><p align="justify">
    Or, in the case of federal merit systems requirements, states
dominated by political attitudes conducive to notions of
professionalization and to the isolation of certain forms of
government activity from the pressures of partisan politics have
had little problem adjusting their programs to meet federal
standards.  They had either adopted similar standards earlier or
were quite in sympathy with the standards when proposed.
Minnesota, for example, has tighter merit system requirements
than those applicable to its federally aided programs under the
Hatch Act.  On the other hand, states dominated by a political
outlook having little sympathy for nonpartisanship in government
administration (Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, for
example) have had a more difficult time adjusting to federal
requirements of this sort, and have often worked to find ways to
circumvent them, even while conforming superficially.  States
with a similar lack of interest in civil service reform but with
an environment shaped by advanced industrial and commercial
organization are generally open to the organizational aspects of
the federal requirements if only because their dominant economic
organizations already reflect the modern organizational approach.
So, even if the dominant political interests in states like
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, or Illinois object to the political
aspects of Hatch Act requirements, they are in reasonable harmony
with their organizational demands.</p><p align="justify">
    A parallel situation exists in regard to the substance of the
federal programs.  Every state has certain dominant traditions
about what constitutes proper government action and every state
is generally predisposed toward the federal programs it can
accept as consistent with those traditions.  Many states have
pioneered programs that fit into their traditions before the
initiation of similar ones on the federal plane or on a
nationwide basis through federal aid.  This, too, tends to lessen
the impact of federal action on the political systems of those
states and also to lessen any negative state reaction to federal
entrance into particular fields.</p><p align="justify">
    Wisconsin's pioneering efforts in social welfare before the
New Deal are well known.  They became the models for many of the
new federal aid programs that were often drawn so as to minimize
the dislocation to that state's established programs.  The
majority of Minnesota's congressional delegation is continually
at the forefront in supporting new federal-aid education,
welfare, and internal improvement programs because as a state,
Minnesota is predisposed toward positive government action and
finds such programs useful in supporting its own goals.  In
matters of national defense, the southern states have a long
tradition of supporting state militia and National Guard units,
so that over the years they have taken greater advantage of
federal subventions for the maintenance of military reserve units
than have most of their sister states.</p><p align="justify">
    States like California accept federal aid and its
requirements for mental health programs as a reenforcement of
programs they have developed themselves.  On the other hand,
professional mental health workers in states like New Jersey rely
upon the same federal grants to keep their programs free of
internally generated political pressures, arguing with the
patronage-inclined legislatures that federal regulations demand
maintenance of professional standards.  Their colleagues in
states like Pennsylvania use federal aid requirements to force
the hands of their legislatures to expand state activities in new
directions.  Reformers interested in mental health in states like
Mississippi are interested in federal aid to inaugurate new
programs.  Many of these and other differences in state responses
within the federal system appear to be stimulated by differences
in political culture among the states.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>               The Political Culture of the States
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The amalgam of the political subcultures in the several
states is varied because representatives of each are found within
every state to varying degrees.  In fact, unique aggregations of
cultural patterns are clearly discernible in every state.  These
cultural patterns give each state its particular character and
help determine the tone of its fundamental relationship, as a
state, to the nation.   In general, the
states of the greater South are dominated by the traditionalistic
political culture; the states stretching across the middle
sections of the United States in a southwesterly direction are
dominated by the individualistic political culture; and the
states of the far North, Northwest, and Pacific Coast are
dominated by the moralistic political culture.</p><p align="justify">
    Seventeen states are predominantly or overwhelmingly
influenced by the moralistic political culture, 16 are similarly
influenced by the traditionalistic political culture, and 17 by
the individualistic political culture.  This division is
paralleled by the relative populations of the three groupings of
states.  The states dominated by the
individualistic political culture used to be fewer in number, but
with a far greater share of the nation's population.  Now they
have reached parity in number and declined to parity in
population.  Thus, while the aggregate population of all three
groupings is growing in absolute numbers, their relative share of
the nation's population has shifted considerably.  Moreover,
because several of the traditionalistic states are undergoing
subtle changes in the direction of the individualistic political
culture, the role of the traditionalistic subculture nationally
is further diminished.  In terms of population, the relative
strength of the moralistic states is increasing.  The figures do
not tell, however, whether the population increase in those
states is reenforcing the established political subculture or
injecting new elements foreign to it.  Neither can the figures
reveal to what extent the moralistic political subculture is
gaining strength in the individualistic states as a result of
social and cultural change.</p><p align="justify">
    What we do see is an overall shift of American national
political culture in a moralistic direction.  This is evidenced
by the new standards of public and private rectitude demanded of
politicians.  Although this shift is the product of many trends,
it also suggests that the shifting state-by-state population
aggregations do reflect real change in the nation as a whole.</p><br>



<H3><CENTER>        The Widespread Application of Federal Principles
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">
    The basic federal division of powers is supplemented by
widespread acceptance of the idea that federal principles should
apply to relations between all governments in the United States.
Hence local governments -- formally the creatures of their states
-- have been effectively endowed with a seat at the bargaining
table hardly inferior to that of the states despite the nominally
unitary state-local relationship. Formal structures have a
certain legal force that contributes to the shaping of the state
and local roles in the American system. They have certainly
contributed to reliance upon grants-in-aid and similar efforts to
stimulate state activity in fields deemed by the national
legislature to demand national effort in place of direct federal
action in those fields.  </p><p align="justify">
    At the same time, the constitutionally unitary character of
the states proclaimed by the courts (often in the face of clear
expressions of the public will to the contrary) sets certain very
definite legal limits to local powers. </p><p align="justify">
    This view, although it can be challenged, has been adopted by
the United States Supreme Court which has reaffirmed it in a
series of decisions beginning with the reapportionment case in
1962.  The Court has made it a point to refer to the unitary
character of the states as distinct from the federal character of
the Union in justifying its rulings. The people of most states
have succeeded in modifying this doctrine by introducing home
rule provisions into the state constitution or adopting them by
statute to maintain the principle of local autonomy. Advocates of
home rule argue that by granting the cities (and counties, in
some cases) the right to determine their own governmental
structures and full power over all local activities except those
of states concern, local government is substantially enhanced and
improved. Since 1875, thirty-three states have provided for home
rule on a constitutional or statutory basis and over two-thirds
of the cities of over 250,000 have adopted home rule charters.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT>
Moreover, in some states, particularly (but not exclusively)
those of New England, strong traditions hold the states to be
federation of towns or counties on much the same basis that the
United States is a federation of states.</p><p align="justify">
    Beyond that, philosophical traditions, historical processes
and political realities have substantially modified the practical
application of both principles of constitutional law. Today there
is no question that, rightfully or not, there are few practical
limits on the scope of federal activities as the result of the
expansion of that government's delegated and implied powers. On
the other hand, at no time in American history has local
government more vociferously demanded that the localities also
partake of the autonomy that comes with federal arrangements.</p><p align="justify">
    In the actual business of everyday problem-solving, political
leaders and the public rarely stop to consider constitutional
nuances. Rather, they respond according to their sense of the
immediate need and the overall "fitness" of things from the
perspective of an outlook that has become second nature. Hence in
the course of the normal give and take of policy-making and
program implementation, the spokesman for the localities assert
their "federal autonomy" -- their right to be considered
autonomous as any other plane of government in the federal
system. </p><p align="justify">
    At times the federal system even takes on elements of a
caricature of itself in reverse with the public and Congress
treating the federal-state relationship as a unitary one and the
state-local relationship as federal in character. Big city
mayors, for example, have insisted that the federal government
force the states to recognize their cities' "independence."  The
fact that there were a number of big cities larger than some of
the smaller states also contributed to this de facto extension of
federal principles. For awhile, in the 1960s and 1970s, they were
successful. However as cities actually declined in population
size so, too, did their influence. The Reagan administration
proclaimed the shift as a matter of federal policy, emphasizing
federal-state relations to the exclusion of direct federal-local
relations. By the same token, as the population of the country
grew, the predominance of the larger cities diminished. The
states, capitalizing on the decline of federal aid and the
increasing financial problems of those cities reasserted their
role, albeit with new activism and greater assistance for the big
cities. This is almost a natural sequence of events in a
political system so heavily influenced by federal principles.  </p><p align="justify">
    In the last analysis, the institutions, politics, and
policies of a state and its localities are so closely intertwined
that no real separation between them is possible. Even when the
biggest cities deal directly with Washington, they usually do so
with their states' active or tacit consent and operate as much as
arms of their states as do state administrative agencies when
they deal with their federal counterparts.  On the other hand,
home rule has not significantly altered the state-local
relationship. The reasons for this lies in the fact that
virtually no local activity is not of state concern or has not
been so defined by the state legislatures. The Colorado
Constitution, for example, grants the right to adopt home rule
charters to every city with at least 2,000 residents. Once a city
does so, it gains full power over all local activities, subject
to state intervention only in matters of statewide concern. While
on paper this is an extreme grant of local autonomy, in fact the
state legislature has ruled that wherever state laws or funds are
involved, the home rule provision is superseded. This covers
virtually every subject except the adoption of the charter
itself. Home rule has proved useful in giving the cities and
counties in home rule states greater power over the structure of
their governments, but in a highly integrated society, has done
little else to advance their autonomy.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>The Civil Community -- <BR>
The Vehicle for Local Action in the
Federal System<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT> 
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The diffusion of powers and functions among many local
governments is the most characteristic feature of local
governmental structures. In most cases it is even difficult to
determine which is the principal government in the local
constellation; the city or the county, the borough or the
township. Only the largest cities and some of the larger counties
(those of over half a million population) have governmental
structures sufficiently comprehensive to resemble that of the
states. But they account for no more than one-fifth of the
country's urban population. For the majority of localities, and
the vast majority of Americans, the network of governmental,
quasi-governmental, and public bodies that give each locality a
political form is less neat and therefore harder to discover. In
them political form is determined by the organized sum of the
political institutions which function in a given locality to
provide the bundle of governmental services and activities which
can be manipulated locally to serve local needs in light of the
local value system.</p><p align="justify">
    Under this definition, a locality becomes a community insofar
as at is organized for political or civil purposes. A civil
community of this kind is, in effect, a smaller and more limited
counterpart of the two civil societies in which every American
lives. The civil community is designed to meet the immediate
civic needs of people living in close proximity rather than the
more comprehensive purposes served by civil societies. Among its
politically significant components are:</p><ol><LI><p align="justify">

     the formal local governments serving the locality (city,
       township, school districts, special districts, county);</p><LI><p align="justify">
  the local agencies of the state and federal governments
       insofar as they became adjuncts of the local community
       functioning primarily to serve it (the state employment
       office, the local post office);</p><LI><p align="justify">
   the public non-governmental bodies which function in
       governmental or quasi-governmental capacities locally (the
       community welfare council, the chamber of commerce);</p><LI><p align="justify">
the political parties, factions or groupings that organize
       political competition locally;</p><LI><p align="justify">
     the interest groups operating within the local political
       arena;</p><LI><p align="justify">

   the body of written constitutional material and unwritten
       tradition which serves as a framework within which
       sanctioned political action must take place and as a check
       against unsanctioned political behavior.</p></ol><p align="justify">

    Every locality with its own comprehensive political system is
a civil community. Such a system provides a wide variety of
governmental services for those who live under it, ranging from
the maintenance of law and order to the provision of recreation
and welfare services. the extent and character of which depend,
in great measure, on local demands. It also functions to
manipulate activities not of local concern alone, such as the
Selective Service and public educational systems, so as to make
them conform with local values.</p><p align="justify">
    Not every locality is equally successful in making the
transition from a congeries of political institutions to a civil
community since not every one is able to create the necessary
network of relationships among the institutions involved. What is
clear is that a "civil community" is far more capable of
asserting its claims within the federal system in both
policy-making and administration than any single local government
acting alone, including the occasional city government that
possesses and exercises broad powers under its state's
constitution.</p><p align="justify">
    American civil communities have existed in a variety of
forms, urban and rural, ranging from the traditional New England
town or rural southern county of yesteryear to the metropolitan
center of today. The New England town and the southern county
were easily visible as civil communities because, in a simpler
age, the community and its political boundaries were identical.
Today, the complexities of government are reflected in the
complexities of governmental structure, at least at the local
level. While city, town, or county lines may indeed delimit the
civil community adequately in many cases, the limits of specific
civil communities may be less easily discovered within formal
political boundaries. In metropolitan America, city boundaries do
not necessarily encompass the entire population of the civil
community, and city governments only partially encompass the
institutions of the local political system. At the same time,
counties are often too large or politically complex to be
coterminous with the civil community, either because urban-rural
divisions within them are sharp or because they contain too many
different forms of urban life.</p><p align="justify">
    Most Americans today live in metropolitan areas which are, in
effect, congeries of civil communities in various stages of
internal organization and development and with varying levels of
intercommunity contact. It must be recognized that most
metropolitan areas themselves are not civil communities, no
matter how integrated they are economically. That is why
suggestions to consolidate metropolitan areas under a single
government have not been adopted. In the last analysis, local
sentiment, political interest, and lines of civic communication
are far more important determinants than commuter flows or bank
clearings.</p><p align="justify">
    Obviously, there is no such legal entity as the civil
community, yet Americans -- particularly those involved in local
affairs -- act as if it were a very real entity indeed. The civil
community is an operational reality because it represents a
characteristically American adaptation of the principle of local
community. America's very fluid, highly mobile and socially
pluralistic society is not oriented toward the development of the
kind of rooted, homogeneous, "organic" community of our European
ancestors. Properly developed, even such limited communities can
have a great deal of meaning; there is no question that they can
have a great deal of influence over those political matters which
affect them and their residents.</p><p align="justify">
    As the etymology of the words themselves reveals, the key to
community is to be found in the ongoing existence of a particular
sphere of communication among relevant communicants --
communication in its original sense of sharing as well as in the
sense of transaction. Obviously, the key to civil community is
the existence of a particular sphere of political communication.
It is not at all amiss to see the problem of creating and
maintaining civil communities as a problem of communication,
especially in the sense of the sharing of a particular kind of
political life. Since the existence of a civil community is more
a matter of the interrelationships between its public and
private, governmental and nongovernmental, political and civic
parts than simply a question of political boundaries, the primary
measure of that existence is the ambit of a particular kind of
political communication, while the primary measure of its
effectiveness rests on the level and pattern of political
communication between and among its parts. That is where the
question of scale takes on added significance.</p><p align="justify">
    Some political jurisdictions, even if they are legally
cities, are simply too large to foster the requisite kind of
sharing among their components necessary for the existence of a
civil community. This is true even if their leaders are able to
manipulate the organized media of communications so as to give
the illusion of community. The proof of that pudding is
invariably demonstrated when the city has to confront internal
and external pressures and cannot produce anything like a common
front. By the same token, some political jurisdictions are simply
too small to contain a complete local communications network. If
they are properly located, they become, in effect, neighborhoods
within some larger civil community. If not, they remain suspended
with no civil community.</p><p align="justify">
    One of the primary tasks of any civil community today is to
function as an active power in the complex network of
federal-state-local relations that is responsible for delivering
most governmental services and benefits to its residents. In many
respects, the test of a civil community is in its ability to
acquire state and federal aids, adapt them to local needs and
combine them with locally provide services into a comprehensive
governmental "package" responsible to the needs and interests of
the local citizenry.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>       Territorial Democracy on the Metropolitan Frontier
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

    The mosaic of American governments and the patterns of
territorial democracy which it reflects and sustains are
originally products of the rural frontier. While those patterns
were tested, in some cases severely, by urbanization (the
urban-industrial frontier), the mosaic survived in basic form to
be reinvigorated by metropolitanization. Thus the 1980 consensus
showed some apparently contradictory trends that can be
understood only in light of the principles of federalism as
Americans understand them. On one hand 73.5 percent of all
Americans lived in what the Census Bureau defines as urban places
(essentially places of 2500 inhabitants or more and 76.6 percent
lived in Metropolitan Statistical Areas. At the same time, only
31 percent of the population lived in central cities of 50,000 or
more people while 37 percent lived in suburbs and 32 percent in
open country or small towns. Even with the growth of very large
metropolitan areas (there were 37 with over one million people
within the SMSA in 1985 containing some 45 percent of all
Americans), the overwhelmingly majority of whom lived in small
cities within those regions. Metropolitan America is still a land of
relatively small local jurisdictions. In an age of great
complexity and despite the efforts of many who have sought, in
the name of reform and modernization, to change the organization
of American local government and the distribution of powers
within the federal system as a whole, the mosaic and its
animating principles have survived. </p><p align="justify">
    Territorial entities such as states, counties, cities,
boroughs, townships, school districts, special districts,
congressional districts, wards and precincts form the basis of
American political life. Territorial democracy means that people
gain formal political representation through their location in
particular places and their ability to capture political control
of those places. Territorial democracy is a neutral kind of
representational system in the sense that specific groups like
the Mormons may choose to settle in a particular place in order
to gain sufficient political strength to secure their own goals,
or specific groups like blacks who have been discriminated
against or who migrate into already established places may
develop sufficient political clout to compete with or even
displace the old "establishment."</p><p align="justify">
    In the scheme of American territorial democracy, the states
are the keystones. It is important to note that the position of
the states rests not only on constitutional guarantees but more
importantly on their ability to function as civil societies by
orchestrating the components of their political systems for
successful action. These components include the formal state
government; the agencies of the federal and local governments
within the state; the public's non-governmental institutions
serving the state; the state's political party organs; the
various interests involved in state politics; and the state's
"constitution." In a similar manner, the political power of
localities rests not so much on legal provisions for local
autonomy or home rule but on the ability of localities to
function as civil communities with the capacity to gain seals at
the state and federal bargaining tables.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                             Summary
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Chapter 9 has focused on territorial democracy manifested
primarily but not only through federalism as a key aspect of the
American political system and how it had been changed through the
impact of the metropolitan frontier.  It began by explaining the
meaning of territorial democracy, how the United States is a polity of
polities or a system of systems.  The chapter then described the two
faces of territorial democracy and how territorial democracy has been
influenced by the continuing frontier.</p><p align="justify">

Special emphasis is placed on the states as civil societies with
comprehensive political systems of their own.  The basic elements of
territorial democracy have focused on the states as the keystones of
the governmental arch.  The federal system is examined in its
political setting, especially how institutions in all territories are
affected by the political cultures in which they are embedded.</p><BR>
