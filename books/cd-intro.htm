<H3><CENTER>               The Jews as a Constitutional People
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

Jewish civilization, its religion and its polity, are grounded in
constitutional documents and infused with the principles of
constitutionalism.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>  Torat Moshe is properly understood as the
constitution of the Jewish people, however interpreted.  Over
centuries, its application has been modified through the addition
of other constitutional referents to explicate the original text
of the Torah: the Mishnah, the Gemarah, and the codes, the last
of which to gain wide acceptance was the Shulchan Arukh. All have
served as constitutional referents for the Jews in one or another
epoch.

</p><p align="justify">

In addition, Jewish states and communities have had their own
chain of constitutional referents in the context of Torat Moshe
beginning with the Prophet Samuel's <I>mishpat hamelukha,</I>
introduced when he acquiesed to the people's choice of Saul as
king and annointed him <I>nagid</I> (high commissioner).<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>  Subsequent
subnational constitutional referents included those of the Second
Commonwealth Hasmonean state, the Jewish community of Babylonia
with the law of its Exilarch, the communal <I>askamot</I> and <I>takkanot</I>
<I>hakahal </I>of the Middle Ages, including such multi-community
efforts as the<I> takkanot</I> of Valadolid which formed a civil
constitution for the Jewish communities of Castille in the
fifteenth century and continued to form the constitutional basis
of the Jewish communities of the Sephardic world until the
break-up of the traditional societies in that world in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. At the end of the
eleventh century, Yehuda HaBarceloni collected model
constitutional documents for founding and organizing communities.
His collection of model contracts, <I>Sefer HaShtarot, </I>relied upon
documents in existence for centuries. <I>Askamot, takkanot,</I> and
later <I>pinkasei hakahal</I> served as constitutional foundations of
Jewish community life throughout the world until the loss of
Jewish autonomy during the modern epoch.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

While no longer comprehensive autonomous "states within a state,"
the new limited and increasingly voluntary Jewish communal
structures continued to operate under basic laws now referred to
in the languages of the countries in which the communities were
located.  In English, they came to be known variously as
charters, constitutions, and bylaws.  In those countries where
the state dictated basic forms of religious or communal
organization, those documents were formulated within the
state-provided framework. In some states, the communities
formulated their own constitutions which were then enacted into
law by the appropriate state organs.
</p><p align="justify">

In the communities of the new worlds of North and South America,
South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, the communities were
fully voluntary.  Each could develop its own constitutional
documents as its members chose as long as they did not violate
any provisions of state law.  Its constitutions could even be
enforced in state courts as legal contracts forming private
associations.  Generally, state law required that all voluntary
associations, including Jewish ones, adopt such organic laws.
Adoption did not guarantee that they would be treated with any
deference or even viewed as important except in those rare
moments when controversies erupted within the body involved and
one or another side had recourse to the body's organic law in an
effort to gain an advantage or prove its point.  
</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>           Constitutionalism in Modern Jewish Thought
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

This casual attitude toward the constitutional documents of
modern and post-modern Jewry was compounded by the fate of
constitutionalism in modern Jewish thought.  There is every
reason to believe that in the first epochs of Jewish history, at
least through the Second Commonwealth, the Torah was viewed as a
constitution or its equivalent.  Josephus, who was the first to
describe the Torah in the terminology of Western (i.e., Greek)
constitutionalism, tried to explain the ideas and practices of
Judaism in the then-dominant terminology of Greek thought.  In
doing so, he described something that rang true to the Jews of
his time as well.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

With the triumph of the Pharisees in the latter years of the
Second Commonwealth and particularly after its destruction,
constitutionalism became more complex with the
Torah-as-constitution increasingly replaced by the
Torah-as-detailed-code.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT> This trend became even more pronounced
in the Middle Ages, during the tenth epoch of Jewish history.
This tendency persisted and became even more extreme on the
threshold of the modern epoch with the composition of the <I>Shulhan
Arukh</I> and its adoption as the standard <I>halakhic</I> authority in
Jewish communities throughout the world.  
</p><p align="justify">

In the modern epoch, there was a sharp intellectual reaction to
this development.  The two great founders of modern Jewish
thought -- Spinoza and Mendelssohn -- laid the groundwork for the
change.  Spinoza in his <I>Political-Theological Tractate </I>accepted
the traditional understanding of the Torah as the constitution of
the Jewish people, but, reversing the dominant trend in medieval
European constitutional thought, claimed that it was the
constitution of the Jewish people only and even for Jews
applicable only in a Jewish state in the Land of Israel.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT>  While
not ruling out the future restoration of that state and its
constitution, Spinoza argued that it was irrelevant for Jews or
Christians until that occurred.
</p><p align="justify">

Mendelssohn also emphasized the Torah as constitution.  Moreover,
since he did not reject Judaism in the way Spinoza did, he made
an even stronger case for its constitutional character in every
realm, not only the political.  Then in his Jerusalem he argued
that this constitution had limited authority and in the diaspora
under modern conditions that it was precisely this constitutional
dimension that Jews had to give up except in the most narrow
sense of Jewish ritual in order to become citizens of modern
civil societies.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

Thus Spinoza provided the justification and Mendelssohn the
direction of the deconstitutionalization of modern Jewish
consciousness.  Their line of thinking was picked up by the new
Reform movement that emerged early in the nineteenth century
which, by transforming Judaism into a religious cult resting on
the ideas of the Enlightment, rejected the binding character of
the Torah as constitution as well as the codes and transformed
the rabbi from an expounder of the Torah into a new style leader
of the cult whose task it was to enable his congregants to reach
out to God as individuals.  Nevertheless, Reform congregations
adopted constitutions which outlined their structure and
functions pursuant to state law.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

But this is not the whole story, for ordinary Jews, especially
those engaged in establishing new communities, writing a
constitution could still evoke the desire to proclaim their goals
to the world and establish the rules of order necessary to
achieve them.  The contemporary constitutions of the Jewish
people speak to that reality as well. So while Jewish
congregations and communities continued to write and adopt
constitutions, if only out of necessity, the idea of
constitutionalism as part of the Jewish experience dropped from
the intellectual consciousness of Jews.  
</p><p align="justify">

Even in Israel, where the absence of a single constitutional
document has persuaded most Israelis that Israel has no
constitution, constitutionalism plays a minor role in public
consciousness -- albeit a growing one. But just because it is not
perceived to be important does not mean that it is not. In fact,
the experience in Israel in the past decade is one of growing
constitutional consciousness, first on the part of the main
institutions of Israeli government, particularly the Supreme
Court and the Knesset, and now among the Israeli public as well.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT> The Israeli experience may not yet be paradigmatic for world
Jewry, but may be a harbinger of what is to come.  At least in
part this is because constitutionalism has surfaced once again as
an important concern in the larger world where proper
constitutions whose ideas are properly internalized by the
publics they serve and hence are properly translated into
appropriate political action are becoming recognized as vital for
the preservation of democratic self-government.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT>
</p><BR>



  <H3><CENTER>      Studying the Constitutions of Contemporary Jewry
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

This necessarily brings us to the study of the constitutional
documents themselves.  Why should we bother to study the
constitutions of contemporary Jewry?  At the highest level,
constitution-making, properly considered, brings us back to the
essence of the political.  However much extra-political forces
may influence particular constitution-making situations or
constitutional acts, ultimately both involve directly political
expressions, involvements, and choices.  In that sense, the
dynamics of constitution-making have to do with questions of what
Vincent Ostrom has termed constitutional choice.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT>  A proper
study of the subject, then, involves not only what is chosen but
who does the choosing, and how.</p><p align="justify">


Constitutional choice is more art than science.  There are
scientific principles involved in the making of constitutions, as
the fathers of the United States Constitution of 1787
demonstrated in their reliance on the "new science of politics,"
which had discovered such vital principles of republican regimes
as separation of powers, federalism, and the institution of the
presidency.  But the combination of those elements and their
adaptation to the constituency to be served is an art.  A
constitution is also a political artifact; making one combines
science, art and craft, including the identification of basic
scientific principles of constitutional design and the
technologies which are derived from them by a constitutional
artisan or group of artisans.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

It is an even greater art to bring the constituency to endow the
constitution with legitimacy.  Constitutional legitimacy involves
consent.  It is not a commitment which can be coerced -- however
much people can be coerced into obedience to a particular regime.
Consensual legitimacy is utterly necessary for a constitution to
have real meaning and to last.  the very fact that, while rule
can be imposed by force, constitutions can only exist as
meaningful instruments by consent, is another demonstration that
constitution-making is the preeminent political act.
</p><p align="justify">

We can and should look at the constitutional documents of
contemporary Jewry from yet another perspective, as indicators
and tracers.  Even if the constitutional documents of
contemporary Jewry have no particular call upon contemporary
Jews, they will inevitably serve as indicators of the impact of
the host culture and the Jewish experience within it on Jews. </p><p align="justify">


As a first step in the revival of a sense of constitutionalism in
the Jewish polity it is necessary to understand the
constitutional documents of contemporary Jewry from two
perspectives: How have they been reshaped by the modern and
post-modern environments in which they have been produced, and to
what extent do they continue older Jewish models?  In other
words, the constitutional documents become another measure of the
relationship between continuity and change in contemporary Jewish
life. Given the origins of so many contemporary Jewish
constitutional documents in the requirements of the external
government, we can expect that the documents will predominantly
reflect the external environment, at least in an overt way.  On
the other hand, one should find either manifest or latent
expressions of the Jewish political tradition within those
documents, in organizational forms if not in style or
terminology.</p><p align="justify">


The U.S. experience is of special interest.  The first
constitutions of Jewish congregations and organizations in the
United States clearly reflect traditional Jewish patterns.  But
as those constitutions were changed or replaced by a more
acculturated Jewish population, they increasingly reflected
American democratic individualism and volunteerism.  At least at
the time of the American Revolution there was deliberate recourse
to constitutional change in the Jewish community to embody the
spirit of that revolution within the Jewish fold.  </p><p align="justify">


In the United States, at least, it is not always easy to
distinguish between American and Jewish influences.  The
constitution of Congregation Beth Shalom of Richmond, Virginia,
adopted in 1789, the year that the U.S. Constitution went into
effect, begins: "We, the subscribers of the Israelite religion
resident in this place, desirous of promoting the Divine worship
which, by the blessing of God, has been transmitted by our
ancestors, have this day agreed to form ourselves into a society
for the better effecting the said laudible purpose, to be known
and distinguished in Israel by the name of Beth Shalom."  What
could be more American-sounding or an obvious imitation of the
newly-adopted U.S. constitution?  Except that constitutions with
such "We the people" preambles are found in Jewish history going
back at least 1,000 years.
</p><p align="justify">

We can identify some of the directions of change embodied in
these constitutional documents.  First of all they move from a
traditional basis, which includes a commitment to Jewish
religious tradition, to grounding in one of the modern Jewish
ideologies with an according diminution of traditional Jewish
practices, even among those who remain faithful to religious
tradition.  
</p><p align="justify">

Second, there is a movement from oligarchy to democracy.
Historically, Jewish institutions have always been republican,
but at various times in history they have been under oligarchic
rule within the republican framework.  That is to say, the Jewish
polity and its communities constitute a res publica, a public
thing, not the private preserve of any of their members, in which
all Jews are ultimately equal citizens.  But the governance of
the communities, if not the polity, often has been in the hands
of a small group who have organized communal institutions so as
to preserve their control.  
</p><p align="justify">

In part, this oligarchic control has been justified in the name
of an aristocratic republican ideal which is fundamental to the
older Jewish political tradition, according to which those who
are special bearers of Torah are given a favored position and are
allowed to form alliances with economically or politically
powerful families.  Early in the modern epoch, as differences
between rich and poor grew in the Jewish community, especially in
Eastern Europe, these bearers of Torah allied themselves with the
wealthy who could provide the resources to enable them to devote
their lives to Torah, instituting severe oligarchic rule within
the community.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13 </SUP></FONT>In small ways it was even one of the propellants
of Jews away from traditional Jewish environments, and those Jews
who came to the United States quickly seized upon the spirit of
democracy abroad in the land to democratize their congregations.
Similar transformations took place in the other countries of the
New World where Jews settled, moderated only by the degree to
which the host societies themselves emphasized elite rather than
democratic rule.</p><p align="justify">


In Western Europe, on the other hand, rule by notables was well
accepted and clearly reflected in the constitutional documents of
the Jewish communities.  Germany, France and Britain offered
three different examples of the pattern.  Germany remained the
closest to the traditional Jewish community, with little
distinction between congregation and community, with overarching
community organization embracing one or more congregations, and
the usual division of power between the <I>baalei batim,
</I>representing the<I> keter malkhut</I> (the domain of civil rule), and
the rabbi, representing the <I>keter torah</I> (the domain of Torah, or
God's teaching) in Orthodox circles or the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I> (the
domain of priesthood offering humans the opportunity of reaching
toward the Divine) in Reform communities, each given a share in
the communal governance with a certain tension built into the
relationship between them.  The result was a matrix of communal
unions federated countrywide.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT>  
</p><p align="justify">

In France the demand of the external society to transform the
Jewish community into a church in the hierarchical Catholic mode
led to consistorial constitutions, essentially forced on the
community by the state.  They vested all authority in the
synagogues and territorial synagogue bodies whose leadership was
to be self-perpetuating, in other words, a religously-centered
power pyramid. This, too, led to rule by notables but it also led
to Jewish efforts to circumvent state-imposed constitutional
limits on their communal-cum-congregational organization.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

In Britain, the Board of Deputies model, introduced in 1760 by
Act of Parliament at the Jews' request and subsequently modified
from time to time as warranted, established the constitutional
basis for rule by the "cousinhood," an interlocking network of
notable families that represented the closest Jewish equivalent
to the rule of Britain itself by its aristocracy.  The Board, a
representative body embracing all or almost all Jewish
congregations and other bodies in Britain, was the center of
communal governance and power in which the peripheries were
represented.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

In the twentieth century all three models underwent
democratization that came to be reflected in their constitutional
documents.  In both Germany and France, the state relaxed or
removed its control over the Jewish community. In the latter,
that relaxation brought a fuller articulation of Jewish communal
comprehensiveness than was possible under the consistorial
system.  In Britain there were fewer structural changes but a
substantial broadening of the leadership base that made the
structures work.  All of this is reflected in the constitutional
documents of those communities.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT>
</p><BR>


<H3><CENTER>Elements to be Examined in the Study of Contemporary Jewish
Constitutional Documents
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

To study these constitutional documents it is necessary to begin
by identifying the realms in which continuity and change is
likely to be expressed.  Governance is no doubt the first in
importance of those realms. How are authority and power organized
constitutionally?  To what extent do the constitutional documents
reflect the traditional Jewish division of powers among the three
ketarim? To what extent do they embody different forms of
organization of power reflecting specific circumstances?<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">
The second realm relates to the arenas of governance, the
relations between congregation and community, local and
countrywide communities, and specific communities and the Jewish
people as a whole.  Are these relationships federal in the
traditional Jewish manner?  Do they take on some other form
reflecting external demands?  In the cases of both governance and
arenas of organization, where it seems that traditional Jewish
practices are being continued, to what extent is that because
those practices square with the specific circumstances of the
community in question.  
</p><p align="justify">

A third element is religious practice.  While here there would be
a difference between congregational constitutions and those of
communities and organizations that are not congregations, it is
still possible to ask whether or not the constitutional documents
reflect particular attitudes towards religious practice, or
embrace or require certain kinds of religious practices or
certain specific practices (e.g., separate seating in
congregations or public kashrut in organizations).
</p><p align="justify">

This leads to the fourth realm, namely relationship to halakhah
and traditionalism.  To what extent do these constitutional
documents maintain a connection with <I>halakhah</I> and the traditional
Torat Moshe?  To what extent do they separate themselves from
them?  To what extent do they ignore the issue?
</p><p align="justify">
Constitutional documents inevitably reflect the aspirations of
those who design them.  One way in which to identify those
aspirations is to identify the constitutional principles embodied
in the documents in question and how they relate to the
traditional constitutional principles of the <I>edah.</I> Elsewhere I
have suggested that the traditional constitutional principles of
the edah can be delineated as follows:</p>


<OL type="1"><p align="justify">
	<LI>  The Torah is the constitution of the <I>edah.</I>
	<LI>  All members of the edah -- men, women, and children --
	participate in constitutional decisions.
	<LI>  Political equality exists for those capable of taking full
	 responsibility for Jewish survival.
	<LI>  Decisions are made by an assembly that determines its own
 leaders within the parameters of Divine mandate.
	<LI>  The <I>edah</I> is portable and transcends geography.
  Nevertheless, for it to function completely, the <I>edah</I> needs
 Eretz Israel.
</OL>

<p align="justify">

These basic principles have been preserved with such
modifications as were necessary over the centuries.  Thus, in
biblical times, taking full responsibility for Jewish survival
meant being able to bear arms.  Subsequently, the arms-bearing
measure of political equality gave way to one of Torah study.
Today the diaspora measure is contributing to the support of
Israel, while arms-bearing is again the measure in Israel.  The
principles of assembly, leadership and decision-making have
remained the same although modes of assembling, leadership
recruitment, and leaders' roles and responsibilities have changed
from time to time.  The portability of the desert-born <I>edah</I> is as
notable a characteristic as is its attachment to Zion.  The Torah
has persisted as the edah's constitution albeit with changing
interpretations.</p><p align="justify">


With those principles in mind we can examine the constitutional
documents in light of three important constitutional principles
of the emerging world Jewish polity.
</p>

<OL type="a">
	<LI> <p align="justify">Torah as constitution rather than code, that is to say, it is
 real as offering basic principles and guidelines, rather than
 detailed prescriptions for every aspect of life.</p>

	<LI> <p align="justify">State and diaspora linked through national institutions in an
 emerging federal relationship.</p>

	<LI>  <p align="justify">Citizenship increasingly voluntary based upon the formal
 obligations of Israeli citizenship in Israel and contributions
 to the Magbit and congregational or organizational membership
 in the diaspora.</p>
</OL>
<p align="justify">

The constitutional documents should help us delineate the
constitutional principles of each Jewish community. For example,
in the American case, we have identified fifteen constitutional
principles:<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></p><p align="justify">


<OL type="1">
	<LI>  Voluntary citizenship
	<LI>  Associationalism
	<LI>  Federalism
	<LI>  Governance through trusteeship
	<LI>  Shared and divided authority
	<LI>  Consensualism
	<LI>  Jewish survivalism
	<LI>  Mutual responsibility <I>(brit arevut)
</I>	<LI>  Vital importance of Israel
	<LI>  Respect for Jewish tradition without necessarily being
	 traditional
	<LI>  Recognition of the Jewish polity as a partnership between God
 and the Jewish people
	<LI>  Recognition of the Torah as the constitution of the <I>edah
</I>	<LI>  Viewing the edah as portable and transcending geography
	<LI>  Pluralism
	<LI>  American patriotism as sacred and compatible with Jewish
 loyalty
</OL>
</p><p align="justify">

These constitutional principles define the basic purposes,
powers, processes and limitations of the polity and its
components.
</p><p align="justify">
With the constitutional principles identified, it is important to
identify the special constitutional terminology or language in
use in particular documents.  Is it traditionally Jewish or is
the language conventional to the environment in which the
constitution was prepared?  Does it reflect the covenantal
element in the Jewish political tradition, the division of power
among the ketarim, the constitutional standing of the Torah,
etc.?</p><p align="justify">


The constitutions of Shearith Israel are excellent examples of
the expressive use of traditional terminology and a slow
adaptation to American usage.  Congregation Shearith Israel of
New York City, the Spanish and Portuguese congregation, founded
in 1654, is the oldest in North America and one of the oldest
congregations in continuous existence in the Jewish world.  No
doubt its founders drew up a set of Askamot (articles of
agreement, as constitutions were referred to in the Sephardic
world) even earlier, but the first set of Askamot of which we
have record were drawn up in 1706.  They were dated in the Hebrew
manner as 5466 and were drawn up by what were referred to as the
"elders of our holy congregation."  "Elders," of course, is the
English translation of the classic Hebrew term <I>zekenim,</I> the
oldest office in the<I> keter malkhut</I>, a term in unbroken use to
describe that function since the days of the Egyptian bondage.
So, too, the term "holy congregation" is the English version of
<I>kahal kadosh,</I> the traditional name for congregations in the
Sephardic world since the Middle Ages.  
</p><p align="justify">
Those Askamot were amended in 1728 to ensure "ye good Government
of our Holy Congregation," continuing to date it by the Hebrew
date. The head of the congregation continued to be referred to as
<I>parnas.</I>  He was assisted by two <I>hatanim</I> (literally, bridegrooms;
used in public affairs as honorees). The <I>parnas</I> was elected and
was empowered to appoint the <I>hatanim</I> as his assistants. The
honors were referred to as <I>misvots</I> and members by the classic
Sephardic term of <I>yehidim.</I> Provision was made for reading the
Askamot (referred to as Articles) twice a year in the synagogue
in both Portuguese and English.</p><p align="justify">


The Articles were further amended in 1761, still utilizing the
Hebrew date and Hebrew terms for the offices and members of the
congregation.  These early constitutions were generally
oligarchic in that once selected by the members, the <I>parnas </I>had
almost complete authority over the affairs of the synagogue.
During the Revolutionary period two more constitutions were
written which introduced a more democratic element, clearly in
response to the spirit of democracy engendered by the American
Revolution. Because of the congregations' general conservatism
and pride in its lineage, subsequent constitutions of Shearith
Israel have kept more Hebrew terminology than is normally the
case, at times coupling an English term to the Hebrew one as in
the case of the <I>parnas</I>-president.</p><p align="justify">


In some cases, Hebrew terminology was simply translated into
English. Another early congregation, Beth Shalom of Richmond,
Virginia, dated its founding constitution "New Moon of Elul,
5549, August 24, 1789."
</p><p align="justify">

Those constitutions of American Jewish congregations and
organizations written by the immigrant generation often contain
some traditional Jewish political terminology, occasionally in
Yiddish or Spanish.  Constitutions written after the immigrant
generation, however, normally utilize common American political
terminology.  The only terminological remains are words that have
been accepted into English such as "rabbi." 
</p><p align="justify">

In the Canadian Jewish community, on the other hand,
constitutional documents are much more likely to express and
utilize traditional terminology, in part because Canadian Jewry
is far closer to its immigrant roots than U.S. Jewry.  (The
predominant models for U.S. Jewish constitution-making go back to
the mid-nineteenth century, whereas in Canada the predominant
models are of the post-World War I period.)  Moreover, the
founders of Canadian Jewry came more directly out of a more
articulated Eastern European kehilla experience than did the
founders of American Jewry.
</p><p align="justify">

Shifting away from these more overt symbols, it is necessary to
examine the functions of the constitutions, particularly in
reference to the distribution of authority and powers and their
effort to justify conservation and/or change.  Does the
distribution of authority and powers express the traditional
patterns of Jewish political organization, history, whether
explicitly or implicitly?  In the United States example we see at
least three patterns.  
</p><p align="justify">

Structurally, most congregational constitutions continue to
reflect the division between the <I>ketarim,</I> with the board as the
instrument of the <I>keter malkhut</I> and the rabbi sometimes a
combination of <I>keter torah</I> and <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I>, and sometimes
exclusively one or the other.  Some congregational constitutions
constitutionalize the role of the hazan, thus giving each of the
three ketarim constitutional expression. In such cases almost
every congregational constitution suggests a desired balance of
power among the <I>ketarim,</I> in most cases clearly subordinating the
rabbi to the board, in a few cases making the rabbi a powerful
figure in the governance of the congregation, and in some cases
seeking parity between the two.  Even where the role of the hazan
is constitutionalized, it is clearly a subordinate one.  On the
other hand, functionally the constitutions of these same
congregations in effect recognize that the role of the
congregation in American Jewry is essentially to give expression
to the tasks of the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I> and to some extent the <I>keter</I>
<I>torah</I> while most of the <I>keter malkhut</I>, other than the direct
governance of the congregation itself, lies outside their
purview.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT>
</p><p align="justify">

The second model is that of the constitutions of the Jewish
community federations.  At least implicitly, these constitutions
recognize that they frame an institution of the <I>keter malkhut</I>
only and have no direct relationship to either of the other
<I>ketarim.</I>  There are some exceptions where provision is made for
relations with or representation of the other <I>ketarim</I> within the
federation but that is not common in the U.S. Jewish experience.
In Canada, on the other hand, the federation or community council
constitutions are more in the spirit of the traditional <I>kehilla
</I>in that they recognize and institutionalize roles for all three
<I>ketarim,</I> including a community council for the <I>keter malkhut</I>, a
rabbinical Vaad Ha'ir (the term usually used) for the <I>keter</I>
<I>torah</I>, and at least a Kashrut Council or the like for those
functions of the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I> handled by the community as a
whole.  The Montreal and Ottawa community constitutions are
perhaps the most pronounced examples of this.
</p><p align="justify">

The third model is that of Jewish organizational constitutions.
American-style countrywide organizations especially are new
phenomena in Jewish history, a reflection of the associational
character of modern and postmodern society.  Hence it is hard to
expect their constitutions to fall into traditional patterns
except insofar as they can be classified among the <I>ketarim</I> and
they embrace purposes which reflect traditional functions of the
Jewish community or expressions of Jewish values.  Some made a
conscious effort to reflect the latter.  With regard to the
former, very few give any explicit expression reflecting their
position in the <I>keter malkhut</I>, but those connected with the <I>keter</I>
<I>torah</I> will often give that connection expression, especially in
the case of rabbinical and congregational associations.
</p><p align="justify">

Current constitutional issues offer another dimension for
investigation.  Constitutional issues are those fundamental
issues that affect the basic configuration and/or
self-understanding of the polity or institution and its
components.  Every generation confronts certain issues of that
kind which it must resolve at least operationally.  The
resolution often is formally incorporated into the constitutional
documents of the community but in any case is incorporated into
its constitutional tradition and understanding.
</p><p align="justify">
Some of the current constitutional issues confronting U.S. Jewry
are:
</p><p align="justify">

1) Determination of citizenship (by whom, how, and on what
criteria). This issue is usually described as the "Who is a Jew"
issue.  This issue is further complicated by the problem of
intermarriage, mixed marriage, and conversion. In the United
States the burden of definition falls principally on the
congregations. Many congregational constitutions simply specify
that members must be Jews.  Some go further and specify Jews by
birth or religious conversion.  On the other hand, at least one
Reform temple only requires that "any person who accepts the
teachings of Judaism and is of good character shall be eligible
to membership in the congregation."  Jewish community federations
usually require that members be Jewish, but do not specify
anything beyond that phrase.  The same is true of most Jewish
organizations, although the American Jewish Committee includes
language in its constitution that allows non-Jewish spouses and
<I>halakhicly</I> non-Jewish children of Jews who are members.  There
are a few congregations that make similar provisions, recognizing
that <I>halakhicly</I> non-Jewish spouses and children of a Jewish
father and non-Jewish mother are not Jewish, but providing that
they can be members of the congregation and are not to be denied
any of its services or facilities.
</p><p align="justify">

2) Institutional reconfiguration to cope with demographic
changes, especially migrational ones.  In the United States the
primary Jewish community was and is local.  This essential
localism could be maintained unrestricted even during
metropolitanization because the integrity of the local community
remained intact even as it spread over a wider geographic area.
Now such factors as the migration to the sun-belt, dual
residency, and shifts from metropolitanization to rurbanization
have challenged the old locally-based forms of organization,
communal and congregational.  To the best of our knowledge, these
have not yet been reflected constitutionally.</p><p align="justify">


3) "Democratization."  The introduction of structural and
procedural changes to enhance participation is a perennial issue
in voluntary communities whose leaders are inevitably drawn from
among self-selected activists who choose to be involved.
Normally an issue most pronounced in the institutions of the
<I>keter malkhut</I>, in the post-modern epoch it has expanded to
include the other two <I>ketarim</I> as well.  Indeed in the United
States most of the highly visible constitutional issues have to
do with such matters as the equality of women in Jewish religious
expression, especially ritual practice but also with regard to
admission to the rabbinate, and who should decide questions of
religious behavior.  Most of these issues are ultimately embodied
in the constitutional documents, whether in changing systems of
leadership selection and representation in communal constitutions
or in defining the roles of congregants versus rabbis, and women
in congregational constitutions.  In an earlier generation these
were often "mixed seating" issues which actually brought
congregational constitutions to be tested in the civil courts in
a number of cases.</p><p align="justify">


These issues are often very disruptive ones, leading to the
secession of groups from existing congregations and formation of
new ones.  In at least one constitution, the mixed seating issue
was so important that the first operational article of its
constitution reads as follows: "Article II -- Ritual and Mode of
Worship. Section 1. The ritual and mode of worship shall be in
accordance with Traditional Judaism.  Section 2. During formal
religious services, the center sections of seats in the sanctuary
shall be used for mixed seating and a reserved area on each side
of the center section shall be designated exclusively for men and
boys, separately from women and girls" (Constitution and Bylaws
of Congregation Beth Abraham, Detroit, Michigan, revised March
1958).
</p><p align="justify">

4) Integration of the religious congregational subsystem into the
larger communal system.  As we look at the constitutional
documents of U.S. Jewry, one of the most striking discoveries to
be made is the degree to which the institutions which together
comprise the community are constitutionally separated from one
another.  It is especially striking with regard to religious
congregations.  Constitutionally, congregations are constituted
as potentially comprehensive communities from the perspective of
the Jewish political tradition, and private associations from the
perspective of American law.  Practically, congregational rabbis
have tended to see their congregations as self-contained
institutions while the membership has tended to see the
congregations as private associations.  The combination has
brought strong reinforcement for the idea that community and
congregation are organizationally separate in all respects.  This
view has become increasingly problematic in an increasingly
interdependent world in which communities and congregations,
especially the large American congregations, must interact for
the common good, leading to the emergence of this constitutional
issue.</p><p align="justify">


5) <I>Edah, medinah,</I> and inter-<I>medinah</I> relationships -- the issue of
how the diaspora relates to Israel and how different diaspora
communities relate to each other.  This issue is most visible in
the constitutions of the world Jewish organizations which provide
for organization in several arenas.  In the U.S., the community
relations organizations claim as their mandate the defense of
Jewish rights everywhere.  So, too, the constitution of B'nai
B'rith International reflects its striving to be the fraternal
body for all Jews.  Of course the countrywide organizations of
U.S. Jewry relate to at least two arenas and sometimes all three.
Some congregational constitutions require their congregation to
be linked to one or another of the religious movements and their
institutions.  As early as 1934, the constitution of the
Louisville (Kentucky) Conference of Jewish Organizations, the
predecessor of the present Jewish Community Federation, provided
for the inclusion of the local affiliates of the Joint
Distribution Committee and the Jewish Agency.
</p><p align="justify">

6) Traditional norms of practice vis-a-vis Jewish tradition.  An
example of this is the development of a "Minhag America," whether
formally, as Isaac Meir Wise tried to do, or informally, to
reflect the norms of American society, even when they conflict
with traditional Jewish practice. Some American congregational
constitutions specify the use of Minhag America.  Others specify
certain religious practices that are indicative of one or another
approach to Jewish practice. Outside of the United States
congregational constitutions tend to be more explicitly
tradition-oriented; that is to say, they require adherance to
traditional Jewish rites and practices. American communal
constitutions tend to ignore this issue, which may indeed be
treated at least by reference in other countries.
</p><p align="justify">

7) Communal discipline and sanctions.  How does one maintain
communal discipline in a voluntary community?  What sanctions can
be imposed if at all to maintain communal discipline?  How much
latitude in Jewish thinking and practice can a community tolerate
and still be a community? In the United States, the earlier
constitutions were more likely to address this question,
reflecting a time when it was still believed possible for
voluntary Jewish institutions to enforce sanctions.  More
contemporary constitutions will have articles dealing with
grounds for denying or forfeiting membership, which are more
likely to have to do with non-payment of dues or lack of
attendance than any religious standards.  Often constitutions
provide for the suspension or expulsion of a member for "conduct
which brings discredit upon the congregation" (Constitution of
Ahavath Achim Congregation, 1960).  Or "a member may be suspended
or expelled for conduct which brings discredit upon the Jewish
community..." (Jewish Community Center of Summit, New Jersey).
Community federations and community councils have organizational
as well as individual members and, indeed, operationally, the
former are the most important.  The constitution of the Albany
(New York) Jewish Community Council is typical.  "Any Jewish
organization which performs an act or operates in such a manner
as to jeopardize the well-being or good status of the Jewish
community" may be expelled, following proper procedures.
</p><p align="justify">

8) Defining citizens' "civil rights" or the right of dissent
within the community.  Shearith Israel, no doubt inspired by the
writing of the first ten amendments to the United States
Constitution, adopted a bill of rights of its own in its 1790
constitution.
</p><p align="justify">

The constitutional documents can also be examined for their
contextual issues such is internal Jewish pressures, the impact
of the external environment, the direction of change such as the
movement from oligarchy to polyarchy (democracy), community or
congregational responses to different patterns of family
organization, efforts of congregations to be the community or
community organizations to replace congregations.</p><BR>



 <H3><CENTER>               U.S. Congregational Constitutions
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

U.S. Jewish constitutions take three forms:  Most of the older
and some of the later ones are written in full-blown
constitutional form -- preamble, articles and sections, and an
appropriate conclusion.  A few are written as articles of
agreement among the founders that include procedures for
congregational governance.  Many of the later ones are written as
articles of incorporation following patterns established by the
laws of the state under which they have incorporated.  While the
latter clearly follows lines of least resistence, it is
apparently not mandatory.  There are legislatively approved
constitutions that follow the first rather than the last format.
Where the last format is followed, elements of the first are
sometimes introduced at the beginning and end of the document.
</p><p align="justify">
Where the earlier constitutions begin with the officers and then
move on to the membership, the more recent ones begin with the
membership and move on to the officers.  This is such a common
pattern that it seems to be a sign of democratization.
</p><p align="justify">

Constitutions are documents that require the consent of those who
are bound by them.  In the early documents, terms such as "common
consent" and "agreed to" are frequently used.  In the nineteenth
century it was expected that members would sign the constitution
individually and new members were required to add their
signatures to the document within a specified time after being
admitted to membership. Neither of these devices has been carried
over into the twentieth century.  Instead, complex membership
regulations have been introduced into the constitutions which
reflects the privatization of congregations, whereby membership
is less of a public act.
</p><p align="justify">

In the earlier constitutions the Jewish calendar established the
rhythm of congregation governance with congregational meetings
provided for either in the month of Elul before Rosh Hashanah or
Hol Hamoed Sukkot and Hol Hamoed Pesach, both of which are
ancient traditions.  By the mid-nineteenth century, constitutions
had changed to specify meetings according to the American
calendar and convenience of the members.
</p><p align="justify">

Constitutional preambles are particularly important for how they
reflect the purposes of the association.  Thus the early
congregational constitutions in the United States, and to a great
extent Orthodox and Conservative congregational constitutions
subsequently, start by proclaiming their desire to preserve
Jewish tradition, while the preambles of Reform congregations,
beginning with "The Constitution of the Reformed Society of
Israelites For Promoting True Principles of Judaism According to
Its Purity and Spirit," founded in Charleston, South Carolina,
January 16, 1825, often state that the reform or "purification"
of Judaism is their purpose -- somtimes at considerable length.
In the Charleston constitution:</p>


    <BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
Whereas, a correction understanding of Divine Worship is not
    only essential to our own happiness, and a duty we owe to the
    Almighty Disposer of events, but is well calculated, at the
    same time, to enlarge the mind and improve the heart....It
    was therefore resolved, on the 16th day of January, 1825,
    that a Society should be formed for the purposes here and
    after mentioned...for promoting true principles of Judaism
    according to its purity and spirit.</p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>      <p align="justify">

Or the Sinai Congregation (of Chicago) Constitution of 1861:
</p>

    <BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
WHEREAS, There appears to exist among Israelites a large
    degree of indifference in religious matters, threatening to
    drag life more and more to materialism and degradation, and
    stifling all nobility of sentiments, all sympathy for higher
    pursuits, all appreciation of the more sacred boons of
    humanity; while, on the other hand, Jewish religious life
    clinging to obsolete ideas and maintaining antiquated usages,
    has taken its course in a direction of which we cannot
    approve.</p>

    4,000 years, most glorious and eventful, is evidently
    destined, in the future too, to act a most important part in
    the development of mankind and in its onward course to the
    lofty position of the Messianic time coming.  </p>

    <BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
THEREFORE, A number of Israelites have assembled with the

</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p align="justify">

More recently (1956), the Leo Baeck Temple of Los Angeles adopted
the following preamble, to cover the range of relationships --
within the congregation and between the congregation, the United
States, and the Jewish world:</p>

    <BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
The purpose of this congregation shall be to worship God in
    accordance with the faith of Reform Judaism; to cultivate a
    love and understanding of the Jewish heritage; to bring
    nearer the Kingdom of God on earth through an emphasis of the
    principles of Righteousness, Justice and Love to all the
    peoples of the world; and to stimulate an awareness of our
    responsibilities as Jews to the community in which we live.
</BLOCKQUOTE></p>


  <BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">
  As Americans of Jewish faith we are dedicated to the
    achievement of a Judaism that contributes to the up-building
    and maintaining of the biblical ideals inherent in our free
    America; a Judaism that will aid us to become spiritually
    sensitive and morally strong human beings; a Judaism that
    draws its inspiration from the priceless traditions of our
    ancestral faith as well as from the rich and enduring
    elements of our American democratic heritage.  We have
    allegiance to no country other than the United States of
    America but we are mindful of the bonds of kinship with our

         which unites all who enter it, whatever their station in

</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p align="justify">

Another point to consider in reviewing contemorary constitutions
is that constitution-makers often borrow from one another, not
only within the framework of a particular constitutional
tradition but across traditions as well. There always was
considerable borrowing within the Jewish fold as well. Indeed,
the Jewish people, like some others, have a tradition of
providing model constitutions for specific communities,
institutions and organizations to adopt.  The oldest model
constitutions of which we have a record were published by Judah
HaBarceloni at the end of the eleventh century in his Sefer
HaShtarot. The American synagogue movements provide suggested
constitutions for congregations and an examination of the
constitutional documents of individual congregations within each
movement indicates that many do adopt or adapt parts of the
movement model.  The Council of Jewish Federations has its model
constitution for the reference of the community federations as
well, but it seems to be less widely used.  </p><p align="justify">

Throughout the eighteenth century congregational constitutions
were also community constitutions, since no community was large
enough to maintain more than one congregation.  Many had
requirements that every Jew in the community had to affiliate if
he stayed in the community for more than a limited period of time
and could be fined if he did not.  While couched in general and
more Americanized terms, it was clear that these congregations
continued the Old World <I>kehilla</I> tradition, or, since they were
almost entirely of the Portuguese rite <I>(minhag haSepharadim),</I> the
<I>kahal kadosh</I> tradition.  As framing documents of putatively
comprehensive communities, some of them tried to deal with such
social problems as to whether prostitutes could become members of
the congregation and how to deal with the offspring of
intermarriages in the congregation, in its services, and in its
school.</p><p align="justify">


These constitutions usually had Hebrew dates, used Hebrew terms
for the principal offices, and for many of the religious
functions and subordinate institutions of the community (e.g.,
<I>porta a echal,</I> a Spanish-Hebrew combination for opening the Ark
where the Torah scrolls were kept, or <I>beit hayim,</I> the traditional
Hebrew term for cemetery).  In some of the documents, the terms
are even printed in Hebrew and incorporated in Hebrew letters in
the legislative charter (e.g., Constitution of Mikveh Israel,
Philadelphia).
</p><p align="justify">

These constitutions focus on the organization of the <I>keter</I>
<I>malkhut,</I> emphasizing the role of the officers first and foremost,
indicating the somewhat oligarchic leanings of those early
congregations. Within the aristocratic republican framework
common to traditional Judaism, every <I>yahid</I> (member) had the right
(even the duty) to vote, but once elected the officers are fully
empowered to act in their name.  Very little attention is paid to
the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I>, usually in the form of a reference to the
hazan or reader of the service, sometimes to the shammash, later
called warden and still later, sexton, and the <I>shochet</I> (ritual
slaughterer).  None have any reference to the <I>keter torah</I>, a sign
of the lack of any rabbinical presence in the United States of
the time.  
</p><p align="justify">

This pattern continues up to the Civil War, after which, through
the influence of Reform, the congregational rabbi takes over from
the hazan as the leading representative of the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I> and
this is so noted in the constitutional documents.  Significantly,
even then the constitutions themselves deal with the <I>keter</I>
<I>malkhut,</I> usually relegating any reference to the role of the
rabbi to the bylaws, where the duties specified for the rabbi are
those of the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I>, that is to say, rabbis are never
called upon to be poskim (rabbinic decisors), only officiants at
religious services and rites of passage. This seems to be the
prevalent pattern down to the present.  Most of the
congregational constitutions emphasize the role of the members,
boards and officers, and give secondary treatment to the <I>keter</I>
<I>kehunah</I> tasks of the rabbi as officiant and sometimes the hazan
in that capacity as well.  Only in selected Orthodox and
Conservative constitutions is the rabbi referred to in his
capacity as representative of the <I>keter torah</I>, usually in
relationship to what his powers are as a posek or a mara d'atra
(resident rabbinic authority).  
</p><p align="justify">

In the period from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth
centuries, congregational constitutions become more "private" in
the sense that it is understood by one and all that there will be
many congregations in the same community and hence the task of
each congretation is to provide religious services for its
members and educational services for their children, and perhaps
some mutual aid as well.  However it is also assumed that
congregational members join to avail themselves of those
services.  Thus there is less emphasis than in the first group of
constitutions on requiring attendance. Also the possibility of
exercising sanctions against those who do not conform, other than
expulsion, realistically has been abandoned.
</p><p align="justify">
More recent constitutions, those of the post-World War II period,
begin to discuss access to synagogue facilities in such a way as
to reflect the synagogues' growing function as a service center
for most members, who are not regular participants or attendees
but who want to be able to hold rites of passage in the synagogue
and social hall or to use other facilities of the synagogue
center. An example of this is the constitution of the Northern
Hills Synagogue, Congregation Bnai Avraham, of Cincinnati, Ohio,
adopted in 1968.  These constitutions rarely contain any
ideological message, although there is a tendency among the
constitutions of Reform congregations to emphasize the heritage
and goals of Reform Judaism, as in the case of the Leo Baeck
Temple, and of Conservative and Orthodox congregations to make
simple declarative statements as to which "forms, practices, and
usages" the congregation will follow -- that is to say,
Conservative or Orthodox. Article 3 of the Northern Hills
Synagogue, Congregation Bnai Avraham, reads: "Practices: The
Congregation shall follow the forms, practices, and usages of
Conservative Judaism."

<H3><CENTER>            Organizational and Communal Constitutions
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

The demise of the comprehensive congregational community early in
the nineteenth century led to the need to establish a new arena
of Jewish organization that would embrace the various
congregations and perhaps other Jewish organizations within a
common framework.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT>  Significantly, the first such efforts were
pointed toward countrywide organization rather than more
comprehensive local communities.  Four major efforts can be
identified in the nineteenth century United States.  The first
was the establishment of B'nai B'rith in 1843 as a countrywide
fraternal organization of Jews.  The second was the establishment
of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites in 1859 to link
all American Jewish congregations and other organizations for
what would today be called community relations or defense
purposes.  The third was the establishment of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations in 1873 to unite all synagogues in
the United States.  The fourth was the establishment of the
American Jewish Committee in 1906 to represent Jewish interests
before the authorities and to encourage local Jewish communities
to form comprehensive community organizations <I>(kehillot).
</I>Paralleling these four major efforts were other attempts to
establish fraternal organizations, representative bodies, and
intercongregational unions, but these were the four significant
efforts of the century.  Their constitutions reveal that special
mixture of tradition and change characteristic of a
newly-Americanizing Jewish community.</p><p align="justify">


There is a pronounced tendency in these documents to use
covenantal terms.  B'nai B'rith is, of course, a classic Hebrew
term to describe the Jewish people as the children of the
covenant.  In its early constitutions, B'nai B'rith also had a
Council of Skenim <I>(zekenim</I> or elders) as its chief administrative
council.  It also required ten Jewish males for the establishment
of a lodge.  At its founding, the preamble of the constitution of
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations referred to the
document as the "sacred covenant of the American Israelites" --
this when the UAHC was committed to uniting all Jewish
congregations in one congregational union.  Covenantal terms
cropped up even among less successful organizations such as the
Jewish Alliance of America founded in 1891 for the absorption of
Jewish immigrants to the United States.</p><p align="justify">


What is characteristic of these bodies except B'nai B'rith is
that they use local congregations as building blocks but go
beyond them to try to include other organizations as well.  Thus
in some respects their constituencies are not clearly defined
because there was no clear definition of constituencies in
American Jewry of the time.  
</p><p align="justify">

The American Jewish Committee, incorporated in 1906, confined its
constitution to simple articles of incorporation following the
form required by New York State.  Shortly thereafter, the
leadership of the American Jewish Committee embarked upon a noble
experiment in their effort to establish comprehensive Jewish
communities or <I>kehillot</I> in New York City, Philadelphia, and
Chicago as a prelude to establishing such bodies throughout the
United States.  The constitution of the Jewish Community in New
York City, as it was formally called, specified its relationship
to the American Jewish Committee in Article 5.  While the
constitution had no specifically Jewish terminology, it did
provide that "the annual meetings of the Jewish community of New
York City should be held during Sukkot week...."
</p><p align="justify">

The Board of Delegates of American Israelites, the American
Jewish Committee, and the Jewish Community of New York are all
<I>keter malkhut</I> organizations in their purposes and structures,
even though the first and last relied upon congregations as their
building blocks.  Only the UAHC has an avowedly religious purpose
which combines the functions of the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I> with those of
the <I>keter torah</I>, since one of their major aims was to found a
theological seminary to train rabbis.  
</p><p align="justify">
As the constitutional documents reveal, for the most part,
nineteenth century American Jewry was devoid of an organized
framework for <I>keter torah</I>, countrywide as well as locally.  The
exceptions to this were the several efforts to establish
rabbinical training institutions.  The Jewish Theological
Seminary of America, which became the flagship of the
Conservative movement, was the first to be established
successfully as an independent rabbinical training institution,
but even it provided for the affiliation of Jewish congregations
and organizations and their representation at a biennial meeting.
Curiously, the 1902 constitution of the JTS makes no reference
whatsoever to its purposes.  Nor could one tell by reading that
document that this was to be a body in fact governed by
rabbinical scholars.  Instead, there are standard articles of
incorporation that describe a lay directorate.
</p><p align="justify">

In the twentieth century, a transformation of Jewish communal
organization in the United States did take place, based upon
local Jewish community federations which, over the course of the
century, emerged as the American version of the traditional
<I>kehilla.</I>  Their umbrella organization, the Council of Jewish
Federations; and the "national" organizations linked to them,
including the Jewish Education Service of North America, the
Jewish Welfare Board, the National Foundation for Jewish Culture,
the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Board, the Joint
Distribution Committee, the United Israel Appeal and the United
Jewish Appeal, and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, constitute
the cornerstones of the countrywide extension of this neo-<I>kehilla</I>
framework.
</p><p align="justify">

Jewish community federations developed in one or another of three
ways.<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT>  The oldest developed out of the linking of local Jewish
charitable and eleemosynary organizations, usually known as
Associated Jewish Charities or United Jewish Charities, which
developed in the late nineteenth century to facilitate
fundraising, beginning with Boston in 1895. The activities of
these bodies were clearly conducted in the spirit of Jewish
self-help and Jewish morality.  The organizational forms they
adopted were commonplace in the United States, though it should
be added that they did not stray from the federal principles and
practices of earlier Jewish communities except in those aspects
that had to do with modern organizational techniques.  They
should be seen both as Jewish versions of various associations
and federations of charities that emerged in American cities at
the end of the nineteenth century or as American versions of the
hevrot and federations of hevrot in earlier Jewish communities. 
</p><p align="justify">

The clue to their essentially American character lies in the fact
that there is not one iota of traditional Jewish language or
custom explicit in their constitutional documents, all of which
are essentially American-style articles of incorporation.  It
would take many years until any Jewish elements would be
introduced into those constitutions.  The framework would remain
American.</p><p align="justify">


The one thing that could be pointed to that may be seen as having
a Jewish flavor is the organizational structure that emerged,
namely a relatively large board organized on consociational
principles, with every constituent organization or institution in
the community represented and a smaller executive committee which
had to report to the board.  This governing structure was very
different from the separate committees that checked and balanced
each other in the medieval <I>kehilla,</I> but it became almost
universal in the Jewish world from the Jewish community
federations in the United States to the State of Israel, where it
is reflected in the relationship between the electorate, the
Knesset, and the government.
</p><p align="justify">
The second stimulus for the founding of Jewish community
federations was the Jewish experience of the 1930s which, on one
hand, led to the establishment of Jewish community councils to
bring together all the local Jewish organizations for community
relations and defense purposes plus some effort at Jewish
cultural expression, and the involvement of local fundraising
instrumentalities in (for that time) massive overseas Jewish
relief.  In the period between 1937 and 1957, these bodies joined
with the local Jewish charities to form Jewish community
federations or federation councils.  These bodies were more
self-consciously part of the larger Jewish world than the
associations of Jewish charities.  These bodies also evolved into
community federations by the end of the first postwar generation.
</p><p align="justify">
The example of the Louisville Jewish community is more or less
typical.  In 1934 the Louisville Conference of Jewish
Organizations was founded as the community's first umbrella body.
It was reorganized in 1954 as the Conference of Jewish
Organizations of Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1971 as the Jewish
Community Federation of Louisville.  The original bylaws provided
that "national Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish
Committee, American Jewish Congress, and B'nai B'rith are invited
to join with the local YMHA, Jewish Welfare Federation, Jewish
Hospital Association, and Conference of Jewish Womens'
Organizations in the common Conference." Perhaps more
significantly, the Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish
Agency for Palestine were also asked to have their local
affiliates join.  (Incidentally, these bylaws contained one
reference to sacred tradition: "the laws and the sacred
traditions of the United States of America, the Commonwealth of
Kentucky, and the community in which we reside.")
</p><p align="justify">

The third model involved a handful of federations that sought to
be <I>kehillot</I> from the first.  In the case of the Jewish Federation
of Scranton, Pennsylvania, founded in 1915, its constitution
defines the object of the Federation comprehensively to deal
"with the general welfare and problems of Jews throughout the
Community, State, and Nation; and to perform whatever acts or
things may be necessary or proper in the accomplishment of these
ends, in such manner as may by it be deemed best."  The
constitution uses the term <I>kehilla</I> essentially interchangeably
with that of federation. The annual meeting is scheduled for the
month of October which may be a secularized continuation of the
idea of communities having their elections during Hol Hamoed
Sukkot.  The Federation was organized into six operating
departments including a Department of Education responsible for
"carrying on the Talmud Torahs for the community."  Other
departments included: Sheltering, Relief, Self-support (an
employment service and a free loan society), Legal Aid, and
International Institutions.  While there were relatively few of
these <I>kehilla </I>federations, their model persists in what are
called the integrated federations of today (for example, the
Jewish Federation of Southern New Jersey) in which the
institutions of the community are either arms of the federation
or are united with it in a relationship that involves more than
being beneficiary or constituent agencies.
</p><p align="justify">
The federations are clearly instruments of the <I>keter malkhut</I>.
While congregations often are members of the federations and
entitled to send representatives to the the federation board,
they do not have a religious standing.  Nor is any provision made
in these constitutions for either of the other two <I>ketarim.
</I>Rabbis are involved ad personam or perhaps in limited
symbolic ways as rabbis, in the form of a rabbinic advisory board
which may be reflected in the federation constitutions.  Except
insofar as some federations were and most now are involved in
Jewish education, they do not touch the <I>keter torah</I>.  Since
federations rarely support synagogues as such, they are even
further removed from the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I>.
</p><p align="justify">

While the United States model has had an influence on the
organization of Canadian Jewry, the Canadian approach has been
more in the direction of comprehensive organization.  This was
first manifested countrywide through the establishment of the
Canadian Jewish Congress, a comprehensive body that, while
principally aligned with the <I>keter malkhut</I>, gives functional
expression to the <I>keter torah</I> and <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I> as well, as
reflected in its constitution.  
</p><p align="justify">

Locally the constitution of the Ottawa Vaad Ha'ir (Jewish
Community Council of Ottawa) is perhaps the fullest expression of
this approach.  Its constitution provides that its Hebrew name is
its official one.  Its purposes are "to supervise and assist in
developing the religious, cultural, philanthropic and national
life of the Jewish community of Ottawa.  To unite this community
with other Jewish communities throughout Canada."  Its membership
is built as a federation of all the city's congregations and
other organizations, represented in proportion to the size of
their membership (which means that this is designed to be real
representation, unlike the equal representation usually provided
for organizations large and small, which is usually symbolic).
Not only that but the synagogues are guaranteed a major share of
the total membership of the Vaad Ha'ir.  According to its
constitution, "the Vaad Ha'ir shall have under its control and
jurisdiction" such bodies as the Vaad Hakashrut, the Talmud Torah
and Hebrew Sunday School, the cemetery, the Hebrew Benevolent
Society, the Hebrew Free Loan Association, the Jewish Community
Center, and the annual fundraising campaign.</p><BR>

<H3><CENTER>                           Conclusion
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

This essay has barely scratched the surface of constitutional
analysis of modern and contemporary Jewry and has only hinted at
the possibilities for applying the same tools historically.  If
this essay has anything to suggest, it is that constitution-
making and constitutional choice are vital aspects of Adat Bnei
Yisrael in all its parts, that they are more than the arid
preparation of constitutional documents.  Rather, constitution-
making involves the embodiment of the constitutional traditions
of the body politic in appropriate binding rules of the game that
properly reflect the polity, its moral basis and socio-economic
distribution of power.  Constitutional choice involves utilizing
appropriate models that recognize the importance of institutions
in the lives of humans, the significance of history and culture
in shaping those institutions and rendering particular
institutions effective or ineffective, and identifying the
empirical and behavioral dimensions of the constitutional process
in each case.</p><BR>

20. It should be noted that the term "rabbi" did not come into
general usage in the United States until after the mid-nineteenth
century. Prior to that, hazzan was the title used for the person
playing a similiar role, in recognition of the fact that his
function was primarily as ritual leader of the congregation.
"Rabbi" was a term reserved for someone traditionally ordained
who represented the <I>keter torah</I> as a <I>posek</I> (halakhic decisor).
The earlier usage was more accurate from the point of view of
Jewish tradition. The new usage was in itself a product of German
reform and the American experience, and has led to considerable
confusion of roles. Thus earlier constitutions referred to the
hazzan in a different capacity, although in fact he too is
basically a vehicle of the <I>keter</I> <I>kehunah</I>.</p><p align="justify">
