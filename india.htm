<H3><CENTER>                   Introduction
</CENTER></H3><p align="justify">

 The Jewish community of India is the fourth largest Asian Jewish
 community after Israel, Asian Russia, and Iran.  In 1948, at the
 time of the founding of the State of Israel, India had a Jewish
 population of approximately 30,000.  Since then some 20,000 have
 migrated to Israel and several thousand elsewhere, leaving a
 community of seven to eight thousand, according to the official
 estimates, most of Bene' Israel origin.  No one knows for sure,
 but the lower figure is perhaps more correct.  The number has
 been stable for several years now, since the burst of aliyah
 following the Six Day War ceased.  It does not diminish because
 the birth rate replenishes the losses due to emigration.  The
 overwhelming majority of the Jews are still concentrated in Bombay
 in much the same situation as they were before.  In addition,
 there are communities in Calcutta, Delhi, Cochin, Poona and a few
 villages in Maharashton State.  There is absoulutely no pressure
 from within India itself for the exodus of the Jews.</p><p align="justify">


 India is almost unique among countires of the world in its
 attitude towards its Jews.  There is no known anti-Semititism in
 India nor are Jews looked upon as in any significant way different
 from the many Indian minority religions.  The character of Indian
 culture -- its relative placidity, its acceptance of diversity,
 and its inherent communalism -- have given the Jews a sanctuary
 the likes of which has never been known in any of the countries of
 the western world.  At the same time Indian Jewry has, perforce,
 acquired the characteristics of the Indian population in general.
 Their social patterns, psychological characteristics, and culture
 all bear the marks of the civilization within which they have been
 located for hundreds if not thousands of years.</p><p align="justify">
 In terms of the organization of the Jewish community, most of its
 institutions other than the synagogue introduced into community by
 migrants from the West during the past century and a half -- many
 more recently of them have survived in a very non-Western society
 only by virtue of a handful of leaders.  As the result, the
 communities can barely support the institutions that exist and in
 all likelihood, will be even less able to do so in the future.</p><p align="justify">

 The Central Jewish Board is the roof organization that gives the
 community an address.  It was founded during World War II by
 Victor Sassoon and others for that purpose.  While it claims
 jurisdiction over all the Jews of India, it is actually confined
 to Bombay and environs because that is where the Jews are.  The
 other communities are too far away although they ocassionally sent
 someone for a meeting.</p><p align="justify">


 19-21 January - Calcutta</p><p align="justify">

 On 19 January, when we arrived in Calcutta, we discovered that the
 USIS information service had found a Jewish confectioner who kept
 kosher and who provided us with a package dinner of chicken and
 trimmings (but later discovered that 25% of the Jewish families
 observe kashrut.  The only kosher slaughtering is of chickens.).
 The confectioner's name is Nahoum and his family owns a shop in
 the New Market.  Through him, we learned where a synagogue was
 located, which we visited the next morning (20 January).  The
 non-Jewish USIS employee who found the synagogue for us was told
 by the people in the vicinity that it is "the place of the
 Zionists".  (He, an East Bengali, has never had any knowing
 contact with Jews before so the terms simply confused him.)
</p><p align="justify">
 Magen David, the synagogue we visited, is the largest in Calcutta.
 It is located in the Old Market, along with the Portuguese and
 Armenian Churches.  According to the plaques on the outside, it
 was built in 1884 on the site of Neveh Israel, a synagogue built
 in 1831.  Its major benefactors were the Elias family.  The
 synagogue itself is large and quite grand, in the Sephardic style.
 Its Ark is a large room behind the bimah in which are located 18
 sifrei torah and three scrolls of the neviim, all magnificent
 work, mostly in silver casings of the Perisan style.  On most were
 tags indicating the name of the donor.  The 18 sefrei torah are
 all that remain of a full room -- most have been sent to Israel or
 London.  The congregational records remain in the building.  The
 siddurim are a mixed bag, acquired from here and there.  One was
 in Minhag Polin.</p><p align="justify">

 The synagogue consists of a great hall with seating in alcoves, in
 the following manner:</p><p align="justify">
 On the back wall hangs a framed copy of the congregational
 constitution.  It is written in Rashi script but in a mixture of
 Hebrew and some other language, perhaps Judeo-Persian.  The
 service times were posted as 5:30 P.M.  There is a daily minyan.</p><p align="justify">

 Since I had to lecture in the afternoon, my wife, Harriet, went
 back at 4:30 to meet the people.  As a result of her meeting, Mr.
 Hyam appeared the next morning at breakfast to talk with us and
 Mr. Moses, the Hazzan of the congregation appeared in the evening,
 when Mr. Hyam also returned.
</p><p align="justify">
 Mr. Hyam brought us a gift -- a worm eaten copy of the booklet
 issued by the World Zionist Organization in 1947 to celebrate the
 50th anniversary of the first Zionist Congress -- framed and the
 story of his life.  He was born in Darjeeling where his father had
 settled in the mid-nineteenth century.  His father was born in
 Yemen in 1837 and came to Bombay via Aden to escape conditions
 there.  Opportunity beckoned and brought him to Darjeeling where
 he earned a living selling wild animals (snow leopards, Tibetan
 tiger, rare deer, etc.) from Tibet to zoos and circuses in the
 Western world.  He also led the Jewish community in Darjeeling and
 was known as Mori Natan.  He was an all-purpose functionary
 (voluntary, it seems) - shochet, mohel, hazzan, etc.  Services
 were held in hs house and, at its peak, some 100 people would
 gather for Yom Kippur.  Hyam's father died in 1934 at age 97.  The
 Jewish community faded away and Hyam later moved to Calcutta but
 he still has two brothers in Darjeeling.  He has two sons in
 Israel, working in the Timna mines and two marries daughters in
 Calcutta.  If the latter, who are contemplating aliyah, move to
 Israel, he will go with them.  He has a minimal Jewish education
 -- whatever he learned from his father (who, to him, was a
 scholar) but he blows shofar on the High Holy Days with a Yemenite
 shofar that was his father's.  One of the ways he eakes out a
 living is by selling Jewish "antiquities".  We bought a "Menorah"
 of kabbalistic symbols, which apparently hung in a synagogue and
 which he claimed was bought by his father from Yemen.  Many
 similar "menorot" were hanging on the walls of the synagogue we
 visited.</p><p align="justify">
 Mr. Moses is the Hazzan of the Magen David Synagogue and has been
 for 11 years.  He is originally from Rangoon, from a Bagdadi
 family.  He came to Calcutta in 1942, to escape from the Japanese,
 just before his bar mitzvah, and has been there ever since.  The
 rest of his family is scattered.  One brother is in Los Angeles,
 another is a Hazzan in London.  His wife is a nurse but has been
 an invalid, unable to work, for the past three years.  He is not
 well-educated Jewishly but at least has the basics.  When he needs
 help he writes to Rabbi Ezekiel Musliah, rabbi of the Sephardic
 congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, who is originally from
 Calcutta.  Elias Musliah, the rabbi's uncle, is the Secretary (or
 chief officer) of Magen David today.</p><p align="justify">

 The community has approximately 160 Jews, all told.  (One estimate
 was as low as 130 and Hyam estimated 250.)  At one time it had
 6000.  Calcutta itself was founded and developed by the British
 and the Jews came -- principally from the Arabian Sea littoral --
 to participate in the commerce of the British Empire.  Those who
 are left are mostly minor clerks or unemployed.  There are five
 synagogues.  Magen David is the largest.  Attached to it is Neveh
 Israel (the original congregation on the site).  There are two
 others (including Beth El) nearby and a fifth in Chinatown.  Three
 maintain daily minyanim, all participants of which are paid!
 Magen David pays best -- over 200 rupees a month (or about IL200),
 a substantial sum in India's economy.  A few extra people come on
 shabbat but even on Yom Kippur only about three minyanim appear at
 Magen David.  Funds for maintaining the synagogues and minyanim
 come from rentals of the stores located on synagogue-owned
 properties.  It was unclear whether these brought in a substantial
 sum or not.  Moses said no but Hyam indicated that they did.  It
 was also unclear whether or not there were trusts in addition to
 this income.  Hyam said yes and Moses said no but both were vague
 and may not have understood my question.  In any case, the
 synagogues continue to survive by paying people to participate,
 without paying them great sums.  They will not merge, either --
 the old story in Jewish communal life.</p><p align="justify">

 There is no overarching organization in Calculatta.  Each
 synagogue is independent.  There are, in addition, certain common
 organziations.  They include:</p><p align="justify">
    1) The Jewish burial board: Moses is the secretary, a paid
 position.  He earns his livelihood as the Jewish functionary in
 town.<BR>

    2) Jewish boys and girls school.  The boys school has five
 students and the girls school, six.  In both cases, the teachers
 are Bengalis.  No Jewish subjects are taught.  The boys know no
 Hebrew but they learn some prayers by rote.<BR>

    3) The Jewish hospital: It has been taken over by the
 government but with the proviso that four beds are reserved for
 the Jews (two male, two female).  The hospital is run down due to
 what the Jews suggest is mismanagement.  They have a low opinion
 of the Indians, especially after the British.</p><p align="justify">

 Fifteen years ago there was a Zionist organization led by a Polish
 Jewish dentist who lectured at the university.  When he went to
 Geneva, the organization collapsed.</p><p align="justify">

 Apparently the community tries to take care of its poor and none
 are as poor as one can be in Calcutta.  However, they do not seem
 prosperous in the least.  Their major outside Jewish contact is
 the Jewish Agency shaliah in Bombay who visits them every so
 often.  He and the Israeli consul there handle aliyah matters.</p><p align="justify">

 According to Bombay sources, in the 1950's there was a Zionist
 Organization in Calcutta, led by a Polish-Jewish Dentist who
 lectured at the University of West Bengal.  When he moved to
 Geneva, the organization collapsed.</p><p align="justify">

 22-24 January - Madras:</p><p align="justify">

 All that is left of Jewish life in Madras is the remembered site
 of an old Jewish cemetery (now a schoolyard) in the original site
 and one Bene Israel girl from Bombay married to a local Hindu.
 Twice there have been Jewish communities in that southern Indian
 city: the first time in the seve
